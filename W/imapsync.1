.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Imapsync command is a tool allowing incremental and
recursive imap transfers from one mailbox to another.
.PP
By default all folders are transferred, recursively, all 
possible flags (\eSeen \eAnswered \eFlagged etc.) are synced too.
.PP
We sometimes need to transfer mailboxes from one imap server to
another. This is called migration.
.PP
Imapsync reduces the amount
of data transferred by not transferring a given message 
if it resides already on both sides. Same specific headers
and the transfer is done only once; taken into account are by default 
Message-Id and Received header lines. 
All flags are
preserved, unread will stay unread, read will stay read,
deleted will stay deleted. You can stop the transfer at any
time and restart it later, imapsync works well with bad 
connections and interruptions.
.PP
You can decide to delete the messages from the source mailbox
after a successful transfer, it can be a good feature when migrating
live mailboxes since messages will be only on one side.
In that case, use the \-\-delete option. Option \-\-delete implies 
also option \-\-expunge so all messages marked deleted on host1 
will be really deleted.
(you can use \-\-noexpunge to avoid this but I don't see any
good real world scenario for the combination \-\-delete \-\-noexpunge).
.PP
A different scenario is synchronizing a mailbox B from another mailbox A
in case you just want to keep a \*(L"live\*(R" copy of A in B. 
In that case \-\-delete2 has to be used, it deletes messages in host2
folder B that are not in host1 folder A. If you also need to destroy 
host2 folders that are not in host1 then use \-\-delete2folders (see also 
\&\-\-delete2foldersonly and \-\-delete2foldersbutnot).
.PP
Imapsync is not adequate for maintaining two active imap accounts 
in synchronization when the user plays independently on both sides.
Use offlineimap (written by John Goerzen) or mbsync (written by 
Michael R. Elkins) for 2 ways synchronizations.
.SH "OPTIONS"

To get a description of each option just invoke:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
or read http://imapsync.lamiral.info/OPTIONS
.SH "HISTORY"
.IX Header "HISTORY"
I wrote imapsync because an enterprise (basystemes) paid me to install
a new imap server without losing huge old mailboxes located on a far
away remote imap server accessible by a low bandwidth link. The tool
imapcp (written in python) could not help me because I had to verify
every mailbox was well transferred and delete it after a good
transfer. imapsync started its life as a copy_folder.pl patch.
The tool copy_folder.pl comes from the Mail\-IMAPClient\-2.1.3 perl
module tarball source (in the examples/ directory of the tarball).
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.IX Header "EXAMPLE"
While working on imapsync parameters please run imapsync in
dry mode (no modification induced) with the \-\-dry
option. Nothing bad can be done this way.
.PP
To synchronize the imap account \*(L"buddy\*(R" (with password \*(L"secret1\*(R") 
on host \*(L"imap.src.fr\*(R" to the imap account \*(L"max\*(R" (with password \*(L"secret2\*(R") 
on host \*(L"imap.dest.fr\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 2
\& imapsync \-\-host1 imap.src.fr  \-\-user1 buddy \-\-password1 secret1 \e
\&          \-\-host2 imap.dest.fr \-\-user2 max   \-\-password2 secret2
.Ve
.PP
Then you will have max's mailbox updated from buddy's
mailbox.
.SH "SECURITY"
.IX Header "SECURITY"
You can use \-\-passfile1  instead of \-\-password1 to give the
password since it is safer. With \-\-password1 option any user 
on your host can see the password by using the 'ps auxwwww'
command. Using a variable (like \f(CW$PASSWORD1\fR) is also
dangerous because of the 'ps auxwwwwe' command. So, saving
the password in a well protected file (600 or rw\-\-\-\-\-\-\-) is
the best solution.
.PP
imasync is not totally protected against sniffers on the
network since passwords may be transferred in plain text
if \s-1CRAM\-MD5\s0 is not supported by your imap servers.  Use
\&\-\-ssl1 (or \-\-tls1) and \-\-ssl2 (or \-\-tls2) to enable 
encryption on host1 and host2.
.PP
You may authenticate as one user (typically an admin user),
but be authorized as someone else, which means you don't
need to know every user's personal password.  Specify
\&\-\-authuser1 \*(L"adminuser\*(R" to enable this on host1.  In this
case, \-\-authmech1 \s-1PLAIN\s0 will be used by default since it
is the only way to go for now. So don't use \-\-authmech1 \s-1SOMETHING\s0
with \-\-authuser1 \*(L"adminuser\*(R", it will not work.
Same behavior with the \-\-authuser2 option.
Authenticate with an admin account must be supported by your
imap server to work with imapsync.
.PP
When working on Sun/iPlanet/Netscape \s-1IMAP\s0 servers you must use 
\&\-\-proxyauth1 to enable administrative user to masquerade as another user. 
Can also be used on destination server with \-\-proxyauth2
.PP
You can authenticate with \s-1OAUTH\s0 when transfering from Google Apps.
The consumer key will be the domain part of the \-\-user, and the
\&\-\-password will be used as the consumer secret. It does not work
with Google Apps free edition.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
imapsync will exit with a 0 status (return code) if everything went good.
Otherwise, it exits with a non-zero status.
.PP
So if you have an unreliable internet connection, you can use this loop 
in a Bourne shell:
.PP
