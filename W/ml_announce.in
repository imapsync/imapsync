Hello imapsync user,

You're subscribed to the newsletter announcing imapsync new releases
(very few traffic) and the way to get them. Send me a note if you
don't want to receive those announces anymore.

You will find the latest imapsync.exe binary (release M4_imapsync_VERSION)
and the latest imapsync source code (release M4_imapsync_VERSION) at the following link:

http://imapsync.lamiral.info/dist/M4_SECRET_PATH/

Three files are there:
- imapsync            is directly the perl script (also found in the tarball) for a fast upgrade.
- imapsync-M4_imapsync_VERSION.tgz  is the tarball containing everything of the project (maybe too much)
- imapsync.exe        is the win32 standalone binary.

What's new in this M4_imapsync_VERSION release can be found at
http://imapsync.lamiral.info/#latest

I thank you again for buying and using imapsync,
I wish you successful imap transfers!

Feedback is welcome!
