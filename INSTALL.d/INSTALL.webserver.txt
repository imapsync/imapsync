The script named webserver in the top directory is a small web server
dedicated to offer the visual interface.  It is experimental and it is
for now a plain text HTTP server (ie, not https).


Dependencies to run webserver on Debian/Ubuntu distributions:

  sudo apt install libnet-server-perl
