DESCRIPTION
    The command imapsync is a tool allowing incremental and recursive imap
    transfer from one mailbox to another.

    By default all folders are transferred, recursively, all possible flags
    (\Seen \Answered \Flagged etc.) are synced too.

    We sometimes need to transfer mailboxes from one imap server to another.
    This is called migration.

    imapsync is a good tool because it reduces the amount of data
    transferred by not transferring a given message if it is already on both
    sides. Same headers and the transfer is done only once. All flags are
    preserved, unread will stay unread, read will stay read, deleted will
    stay deleted. You can stop the transfer at any time and restart it
    later, imapsync works well with bad connections.

    You can decide to delete the messages from the source mailbox after a
    successful transfer, it can be a good feature when migrating live
    mailboxes since messages will be only on one side. In that case, use the
    --delete option. Option --delete implies also option --expunge so all
    messages marked deleted on host1 will be really deleted. (you can use
    --noexpunge to avoid this but I don't see any good real world scenario
    for the combinaison --delete --noexpunge).

    You can also just synchronize a mailbox B from another mailbox A in case
    you just want to keep a "live" copy of A in B. In that case --delete2
    can be used, it deletes messages in host2 folder B that are not in host1
    folder A.

    imapsync is not adequate for maintaining two active imap accounts in
    synchronization where the user plays independently on both sides. Use
    offlineimap (written by John Goerzen) or mbsync (written by Michael R.
    Elkins) for 2 ways synchronizations.

OPTIONS
    To get a description of each option just invoke:

    imapsync --help

HISTORY
    I wrote imapsync because an enterprise (basystemes) paid me to install a
    new imap server without losing huge old mailboxes located on a far away
    remote imap server accessible by a low bandwidth link. The tool imapcp
    (written in python) could not help me because I had to verify every
    mailbox was well transferred and delete it after a good transfer.
    imapsync started life as a copy_folder.pl patch. The tool copy_folder.pl
    comes from the Mail-IMAPClient-2.1.3 perl module tarball source (in the
    examples/ directory of the tarball).

EXAMPLE
    While working on imapsync parameters please run imapsync in dry mode (no
    modification induced) with the --dry option. Nothing bad can be done
    this way.

    To synchronize the imap account "buddy" (with password "secret1") on
    host "imap.src.fr" to the imap account "max" (with password "secret2")
    on host "imap.dest.fr":

     imapsync --host1 imap.src.fr  --user1 buddy --password1 secret1 \
              --host2 imap.dest.fr --user2 max   --password2 secret2

    Then you will have max's mailbox updated from buddy's mailbox.

SECURITY
    You can use --passfile1 instead of --password1 to give the password
    since it is safer. With --password1 option any user on your host can see
    the password by using the 'ps auxwwww' command. Using a variable (like
    $PASSWORD1) is also dangerous because of the 'ps auxwwwwe' command. So,
    saving the password in a well protected file (600 or rw-------) is the
    best solution.

    imasync is not totally protected against sniffers on the network since
    passwords may be transferred in plain text if CRAM-MD5 is not supported
    by your imap servers. Use --ssl1 (or --tls1) and --ssl2 (or --tls2) to
    enable encryption on host1 and host2.

    You may authenticate as one user (typically an admin user), but be
    authorized as someone else, which means you don't need to know every
    user's personal password. Specify --authuser1 "adminuser" to enable this
    on host1. In this case, --authmech1 PLAIN will be used by default since
    it is the only way to go for now. So don't use --authmech1 SOMETHING
    with --authuser1 "adminuser", it will not work. Same behavior with the
    --authuser2 option. Authenticate with an admin account must be supported
    by your imap server to work with imapsync.

    When working on Sun/iPlanet/Netscape IMAP servers you must use
    --proxyauth1 to enable administrative user to masquerade as another
    user. Can also be used on destination server with --proxyauth2

    You can authenticate with OAUTH when transfering from Google Apps. The
    consumer key will be the domain part of the --user, and the --password
    will be used as the consumer secret. It does not work with Google Apps
    free edition.

EXIT STATUS
    imapsync will exit with a 0 status (return code) if everything went
    good. Otherwise, it exits with a non-zero status.

    So if you have an unreliable internet connection, you can use this loop
    in a Bourne shell:

            while ! imapsync ...; do 
                  echo imapsync not complete
            done

    Feedback good or bad is very often welcome.

    Gilles LAMIRAL earns his living by writing, installing, configuring and
    teaching free, open and often gratis softwares. It used to be "always
    gratis" but now it is "often" because imapsync is sold by its author, a
    good way to stay maintening and supporting free open public softwares
    (see the license) over decades.

BUG REPORT GUIDELINES
    Help me to help you: follow the following guidelines.

    Report any bugs or feature requests to the public mailing-list or to the
    author.

    Before reporting bugs, read the FAQ, the README and the TODO files.
    http://imapsync.lamiral.info/

    Upgrade to last imapsync release, maybe the bug is already fixed.

    Upgrade to last Mail-IMAPClient Perl module.
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-IMAPClient/ maybe the bug is already
    fixed there.

    Make a good title with word "imapsync" in it (my spam filter won't
    filter it), Try to write an email title with more words than just
    "imapsync" or "problem", a good title is made of keywords summary, but
    not too long (one visible line).

    Help us to help you: in your report, please include:

     - imapsync version.

     - output near the first failures, a few lines before is good to get the context
       of the issue. First failures messages are often more significant than 
       the last ones. 
 
     - if the issue is always related to the same messages, include the output 
       with --debug --debugimap, near the failure point. For example,
       Isolate a buggy message or two in a folder 'BUG' and use 

         imapsync ... --folder 'BUG' --debug --debugimap 

     - imap server softwares on both sides and their version number.

     - imapsync with all the options you use,  the full command line
       you use (except the passwords of course). 

     - IMAPClient.pm version.

     - the run context. Do you run imapsync.exe, a unix binary 
       or the perl script imapsync.

     - operating system running imapsync.

     - virtual software context (vmware, xen etc.)

     - operating systems on both sides and the third side in case
       you run imapsync on a foreign host from the both.

    Most of those values can be found as a copy/paste at the begining of the
    output, so a carbon copy of the output is a very easy and very good
    debug report for me.

    One time in your life, read the paper "How To Ask Questions The Smart
    Way" http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html and then forget
    it.

IMAP SERVERS
    Failure stories reported in the past with the following 6 imap servers.
    Maybe last imapsync release can run successfully with them. Don't
    hesitate to have a try, It's been a long time since last failure
    occured, I will help you and make efforts to switch them to the success
    list, that's my job.

     - MailEnable 1.54 (Proprietary) but MailEnable 4.23 is supported. 
     - DBMail 0.9, 2.0.7 (GPL). But DBMail 1.2.1 is supported.
       Patient and confident testers are welcome.
     - Imail 7.04 (maybe).
     - (2011) MDaemon 12.0.3 as host2 but MDaemon is supported as host1.
       MDaemon is simply buggy with the APPEND IMAP command with 
       any IMAP email client.
     - Hotmail since hotmail.com does not provide IMAP access
     - Outlook.com since outlook.com does not provide IMAP access

    Please report to the author any success or bad story with imapsync and
    do not forget to mention the IMAP server software names and version on
    both sides. This will help future users. To help the author maintaining
    this section report the two lines at the begining of the output if they
    are useful to know the softwares. Example:

     Host1 software:* OK louloutte Cyrus IMAP4 v1.5.19 server ready
     Host2 software:* OK Courier-IMAP ready

    You can use option --justconnect to get those lines. Example:

      imapsync --host1 imap.troc.org --host2 imap.trac.org --justconnect

HUGE MIGRATION
    Pay special attention to options --subscribed --subscribe --delete
    --delete2 --delete2folders --maxage --minage --maxsize --useuid
    --usecache

    If you have many mailboxes to migrate think about a little shell
    program. Write a file called file.txt (for example) containing users and
    passwords. The separator used in this example is ';'

    The file.txt file contains:

    user001_1;password001_1;user001_2;password001_2
    user002_1;password002_1;user002_2;password002_2
    user003_1;password003_1;user003_2;password003_2
    user004_1;password004_1;user004_2;password004_2
    user005_1;password005_1;user005_2;password005_2 ...

    On Unix the shell program can be:

     { while IFS=';' read  u1 p1 u2 p2; do 
            imapsync --host1 imap.side1.org --user1 "$u1" --password1 "$p1" \
                     --host2 imap.side2.org --user2 "$u2" --password2 "$p2" ...
     done ; } < file.txt

    On Windows the batch program can be:

      FOR /F "tokens=1,2,3,4 delims=; eol=#" %%G IN (file.txt) DO imapsync ^
      --host1 imap.side1.org --user1 %%G --password1 %%H ^
      --host2 imap.side2.org --user2 %%I --password2 %%J ...

    The ... have to be replaced by nothing or any imapsync option. Welcome
