INSTALL
     imapsync works fine under any Unix OS with perl.
     imapsync works fine under Windows (2000, XP) and ActiveState's 5.8 Perl

     imapsync is already available directly on the following distributions (at least):
     FreeBSD, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, NetBSD, Darwin, Mandriva and OpenBSD (yeah!).

DESCRIPTION
    The command imapsync is a tool allowing incremental and recursive imap
    transfer from one mailbox to another.

    By default all folders are transferred, recursively.

    We sometimes need to transfer mailboxes from one imap server to another.
    This is called migration.

    imapsync is a good tool because it reduces the amount of data
    transferred by not transferring a given message if it is already on both
    sides. Same headers, same message size and the transfer is done only
    once. All flags are preserved, unread will stay unread, read will stay
    read, deleted will stay deleted. You can stop the transfer at any time
    and restart it later, imapsync works well with bad connections. imapsync
    is CPU hungry so nice and renice commands can be a good help. imapsync
    can be memory hungry too, especially with large messages.

    You can decide to delete the messages from the source mailbox after a
    successful transfer (it is a good feature when migrating). In that case,
    use the --delete --expunge1 options.

    You can also just synchronize a mailbox A from another mailbox B in case
    you just want to keep a "live" copy of B in A.

OPTIONS
    To get a description of each option just invoke:

    imapsync --help

HISTORY
    I wrote imapsync because an enterprise (basystemes) paid me to install a
    new imap server without losing huge old mailboxes located on a far away
    remote imap server accessible by a low bandwidth link. The tool imapcp
    (written in python) could not help me because I had to verify every
    mailbox was well transferred and delete it after a good transfer.
    imapsync started life as a copy_folder.pl patch. The tool copy_folder.pl
    comes from the Mail-IMAPClient-2.1.3 perl module tarball source (in the
    examples/ directory of the tarball).

EXAMPLE
    While working on imapsync parameters please run imapsync in dry mode (no
    modification induced) with the --dry option. Nothing bad can be done
    this way.

    To synchronize the imap account "buddy" on host "imap.src.fr" to the
    imap account "max" on host "imap.dest.fr" (the passwords are located in
    two files "/etc/secret1" for "buddy", "/etc/secret2" for "max"):

     imapsync --host1 imap.src.fr  --user1 buddy --passfile1 /etc/secret1 \
              --host2 imap.dest.fr --user2 max   --passfile2 /etc/secret2

    Then, you will have max's mailbox updated from buddy's mailbox.

SECURITY
    You can use --password1 instead of --passfile1 to give the password but
    it is dangerous because any user on your host can see the password by
    using the 'ps auxwwww' command. Using a variable (like $PASSWORD1) is
    also dangerous because of the 'ps auxwwwwe' command. So, saving the
    password in a well protected file (600 or rw-------) is the best
    solution.

    imasync is not totally protected against sniffers on the network since
    passwords may be transferred in plain text if CRAM-MD5 is not supported
    by your imap servers. Use --ssl1 (or --tls1) and --ssl2 (or --tls2) to
    enable encryption on host1 and host2.

    You may authenticate as one user (typically an admin user), but be
    authorized as someone else, which means you don't need to know every
    user's personal password. Specify --authuser1 "adminuser" to enable this
    on host1. In this case, --authmech1 PLAIN will be used by default since
    it is the only way to go for now. So don't use --authmech1 SOMETHING
    with --authuser1 "adminuser", it will not work. Same behavior with the
    --authuser2 option.

EXIT STATUS
    imapsync will exit with a 0 status (return code) if everything went
    good. Otherwise, it exits with a non-zero status.

    So if you have an unreliable internet connection, you can use this loop
    in a Bourne shell:

            while ! imapsync ...; do 
                  echo imapsync not complete
            done

AUTHOR
    Gilles LAMIRAL <lamiral@linux-france.org>

    Feedback good or bad is always welcome.

    The newsgroup comp.mail.imap may be a good place to talk about imapsync.
    I read it when imapsync is concerned. A better place is the public
    imapsync mailing-list (see below).

    Gilles LAMIRAL earns his living writing, installing, configuring and
    teaching free, open and gratis softwares. Do not hesitate to pay him for
    that services.

BUG REPORT GUIDELINES
    Report any bugs or feature requests to the public mailing-list or to the
    author.

    Help us to help you: follow the following guidelines.

    One time in your life, read the paper "How To Ask Questions The Smart
    Way" http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

    Before reporting bugs, read the FAQ, the README and the TODO files.
    http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync/

    Upgrade to last imapsync release, maybe the bug is already fixed.

    Upgrade to last Mail-IMAPClient Perl module.
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-IMAPClient/

    Make a good title with word "imapsync" in it (my spam filter won't
    filter it), Don't write an email title with just "imapsync" or
    "problem", a good title is made of keywords summary, not too long (one
    visible line).

    Don't write imapsync in uppercase in the email title, we'll know you run
    windows(tm) and you haven't read the README yet.

    Help us to help you: in your report, please include:

     - imapsync version.
     - output given with --debug --debugimap near the failure point.
       Isolate a message in a folder 'BUG' and use --folder 'BUG'
     - imap server software on both side and their version number.
     - imapsync with all the options you use,  the full command line
       you use (except the passwords of course). 
     - IMAPClient.pm version.
     - operating system running imapsync.
     - operating systems on both sides and the third side in case
       you run imapsync on a foreign host from the both.
     - virtual software context (vmware, xen etc.)

     Most of those values can be found as a copy/paste at the begining of the output.

    Please report to the author any success or bad story with imapsync and
    do not forget to mention the IMAP server software names and version on
    both sides. This will help future users. To help the author maintaining
    this section report the two lines at the begining of the output if they
    are useful to know the softwares. Example:

     Host1 software:* OK louloutte Cyrus IMAP4 v1.5.19 server ready
     Host2   software:* OK Courier-IMAP ready

    You can use option --justconnect to get those lines. Example:

      imapsync --host1 imap.troc.org --host2 imap.trac.org --justconnect

    Please rate imapsync at http://freshmeat.net/projects/imapsync/ or
    better give the author a book, he likes books:
    http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1C9UNDIH3P7R7/ (or its paypal
    account gilles.lamiral@laposte.net)

HUGE MIGRATION
    Pay special attention to options --subscribed --subscribe --delete
    --delete2 --expunge --expunge1 --expunge2 --uidexpunge2 --maxage
    --minage --maxsize --useheader --fast

    If you have many mailboxes to migrate think about a little shell
    program. Write a file called file.csv (for example) containing users and
    passwords. The separator used in this example is ';'

    The file.csv file contains:

    user0001;password0001;user0002;password0002
    user0011;password0011;user0012;password0012 ...

    And the shell program is just:

     { while IFS=';' read  u1 p1 u2 p2; do 
            imapsync --user1 "$u1" --password1 "$p1" --user2 "$u2" --password2 "$p2" ...
     done ; } < file.csv

    Welcome in shell programming !
