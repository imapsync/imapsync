=======================================================================
      Imapsync tips for Zimbra. Specific issues and solutions.
=======================================================================

Please, don't follow
https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Guide_to_imapsync
It's obsolete and it will give you, and me, more difficulties than 
doing a standard sync without additional options.

Questions answered in this FAQ are:

Q. How to migrate from Zimbra to XXX?

Q. How to migrate from Zimbra with an admin account?

Q. I got this "NO APPEND failed" error:
could not append ( Subject:... Flags:[\Flagged \Seen EmailswithStickyNotes:FLAG51135] ) 
to folder XXX: 316 NO APPEND failed
What can I do?

Q. Zimbra disconnects without reason
   Could not select: * BYE ... Zimbra IMAP4rev1 server closing connection


Now the questions again with their answers.


=======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from Zimbra to XXX?

The basic default (only credendials) should work fine with Zimbra.


=======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from Zimbra with an admin account?

R. Use:

  imapsync ... --user1 "normal_user" --authuser1 "admin_user"  --password1 "admin_user_password"

To setup or use a Zimbra admin user see:
https://zimbra.github.io/adminguide/8.8.9/index.html#_administrator_accounts

Flagging
Users can create flags and assign them to messages, contacts, and files in Briefcase folders.
In the Admin Console, see COS -> Features -> Mail Features container

Is Flagging on on host2? 
If yes, see https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Flags.txt

=======================================================================
Q. Zimbra disconnects without reason
   Could not select: * BYE ... Zimbra IMAP4rev1 server closing connection

R. The cause of this problem may be that some users have a subscription 
   of a shared folder from a mailbox locked and so the shared folder.
   The access problems may happen in a lot of folders, 
   not only the shared/locked one.

   It should work after removing the locked/shared folder.

   Thanks to Danny Herrlitz for this input!
