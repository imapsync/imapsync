Q. How to deal with huge mailboxes, whose size is over dozens of GB?

R1. It should be ok with imapsync.  

Sometimes with big folders, imapsync seems to stall when sizing the
folders or maybe before syncing a huge folder. So you wonder whether
imapsync is doing something or being just frozen. A solution to
increase the verbosity is to add the option --debugimap. Option
--debugimap shows what is currently done, it's quite a big output but
it helps to wait, saying to ourselves "ok it's long but it's working,
let's wait a little more".  The real purpose of --debugimap is to show
genuine IMAP commands used and their responses. The problem with
--debugimap is that it is very verbose and so with a big mailbox it
generates a very BIG logfile.

R2. If it is not ok with imapsync, the sync finally fails, then 
consider spliting the whole sync into smaller chunks using 
the option --search

For example, select messages only for a given year:

...
..imapsync ... --search "SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2017 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2017"
  imapsync ... --search "SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2018 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2018"
  imapsync ... --search "SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2019 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2019"

R3. Use option --useuid
Option --useuid speeds up the process but --useuid implies --usecache
and --usecache may trigger some issues sometimes. Read:
https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Use_cache.txt

Don't use --useuid in Docker context, the cache will be destroyed 
each time, or put it in a stable place, I don't know how to do it,
I just know it's possible and not very difficult.
