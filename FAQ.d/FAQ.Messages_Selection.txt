=======================================================================
Q. What messages imapsync syncs by default?

R. By default, Imapsync syncs all messages, except duplicates.

=======================================================================
Q. Is there a way we can specify a date range to sync emails? 
   If yes, can you please share an example?

R. Yes, a date range is possible with the --search option.

  imapsync ... --search "SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2010" 
  
or 
  
  imapsync ... --search "SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2010"

or
  
  imapsync ... --search "SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2010 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2010"

  Months are specified like this:
  
   Jan
   Feb
   Mar
   Apr
   May 
   Jun
   Jul 
   Aug
   Sep
   Oct 
   Nov
   Dec

=======================================================================
Q. Is there a way we can specify an age to sync emails? 
   If yes, can you please share some examples?

R. Yes, with the --maxage or the --minage option.

E.1 Sync only messages less than 2 days old:

  imapsync ... --maxage 2

E.2 Sync only messages more than 2 days old:

  imapsync ... --minage 2

E.3 Sync only messages more than 30 days old and less than 365 days old:

  imapsync ... --minage 30 --maxage 365

E.4 Sync only messages less than 30 days old or more than 365 days old:

  imapsync ... --maxage 30 --minage 365

Full explanation:

--maxage      <int>    : Skip messages older than <int> days.
                         final stats (skipped) don't count older messages
                         see also --minage
--minage      <int>    : Skip messages newer than <int> days.
                         final stats (skipped) don't count newer messages
                         You can do (+ are the messages selected):
                         past|----maxage+++++++++++++++>now
                         past|+++++++++++++++minage---->now
                         past|----maxage+++++minage---->now (intersection)
                         past|++++minage-----maxage++++>now (union)

C.1 By default,

  option --maxage is implemented as a --search SENTSINCE 
RFC 3501 says: SENTSINCE <date>
Messages whose [RFC-2822] Date: header (disregarding time and
timezone) is within or later than the specified date.

  Option --minage is implemented as a --search SENTBEFORE
RFC 3501 says: SENTBEFORE <date>
Messages whose [RFC-2822] Date: header (disregarding time and
timezone) is earlier than the specified date.

If --noabletosearch is on then --minage and --maxage deal
with the internal dates given by a FETCH imap command but 
not the Date: header. Internal date is the arrival date 
in the mailbox. Same remark for --noabletosearch1 and
--noabletosearch2 but only for one side then.

=======================================================================
Q. I want to sync messages based on their UID.

R. First have in mind that UIDs are unique only per folder, so work this
   way only with one folder at a time, with --folder option.

To show UIDs, there is the --debugLIST parameter.

  imapsync ...  --debugLIST

To sync only a part of all messages, selected by UIDs 
from 10000 to 11000:

  imapsync ... --search1 "UID 10000:11000" 

To sync from INBOX only 3 messages UIDs 20000 20002 20004:

  imapsync ... --search1 'OR OR UID 20000 UID 20002 UID 20004' --folder INBOX

To sync all messages from INBOX except 3 messages 
UIDs 20000 20002 20004:

  imapsync ... --search1 'NOT OR OR UID 20000 UID 20002 UID 20004' --folder INBOX

If you search n UIDs then you have to put n-1 OR in the search line,
that's IMAP.

=======================================================================
Q. Can I migrate only mails with attachments?

R. Use:

  imapsync ... --search "HEADER Content-Type multipart/mixed" 

or more generally:

  imapsync ... --search "OR HEADER Content-Disposition attachment HEADER Content-Type multipart/mixed" 


=======================================================================
Q. How can I move messages marked \Deleted from all folders to
   a dedicated folder?

R. To move \Deleted messages from all folders to a specific folder, 
   let's call it Trash, use:

  imapsync ... --search DELETED --regextrans2 "s/.*/Trash/" 

=======================================================================
Q. What are the selection criteria available with --search option?

R. The list of search criteria are listed below, an excerpt from RFC3501.

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3501.html

6.4.4.  SEARCH Command
...
      ALL
         All messages in the mailbox; the default initial key for
         ANDing.

      ANSWERED
         Messages with the \Answered flag set.

      BCC <string>
         Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope
         structure's BCC field.

      BEFORE <date>
         Messages whose internal date (disregarding time and timezone)
         is earlier than the specified date.

         Messages that contain the specified string in the body of the
         message.

      CC <string>
         Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope
         structure's CC field.

      DELETED
         Messages with the \Deleted flag set.

      HEADER <field-name> <string>
         Messages that have a header with the specified field-name (as
         defined in [RFC-2822]) and that contains the specified string
         in the text of the header (what comes after the colon).  If the
         string to search is zero-length, this matches all messages that
         have a header line with the specified field-name regardless of
         the contents.

         is within the specified date.

         body of the message.

         structure's TO field.

         unique identifier set.  Sequence set ranges are permitted.
