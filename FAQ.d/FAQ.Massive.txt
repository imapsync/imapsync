=======================================================================

Questions answered here are:

Q. I need to migrate hundred accounts, how can I do?

Q. I have to migrate 500k users using 400 TB of disk space. 
   How do I proceed? How about speed?

Q. How to determine where is the bottleneck in an imapsync process?

Q. Can I run more instances of imapsync in parallel on a Windows host?

Q. I run multiple imapsync applications at the same time then get a
   warning "imapsync.pid already exists, overwriting it".
   Is this a potential problem when trying to sync multiple 
   IMAP account in parallel?


=======================================================================
Q. I need to migrate hundred accounts, how can I do?

R. If you have many mailboxes to migrate think about a little
script program. Write a file called file.txt (for example)
containing hosts, users and passwords on both sides.
The separator used in this example is ";"

The file.txt file contains for example:

host001_1;user001_1;password001_1;host001_2;user001_2;password001_2;
host002_1;user002_1;password002_1;host002_2;user002_2;password002_2;
host003_1;user003_1;password003_1;host003_2;user003_2;password003_2;
host004_1;user004_1;password004_1;host004_2;user004_2;password004_2;
etc.

Most of the times, the first column (host001_1, host002_1 ...) will
contains the same value, the value of --host1 parameter. Same
thing for the third column (host001_2, host002_2).

On Unix the shell script can be:

#!/bin/sh
{ while IFS=';' read  h1 u1 p1 h2 u2 p2 fake
    do 
        imapsync --host1 "$h1" --user1 "$u1" --password1 "$p1" \
                 --host2 "$h2" --user2 "$u2" --password2 "$p2" "$@" 
    done 
} < file.txt

You can add extra options inside this script, just after the variable "$@".
You can also pass extra options via the parameters of this script 
since they will go in "$@"

Here is a complete Unix example ready to use: 
http://imapsync.lamiral.info/examples/sync_loop_unix.sh


On Windows the batch script can be:

CD /D %~dp0
SET csvfile=file.txt
FOR /F "tokens=1,2,3,4,5,6,7 delims=; eol=#" %%G IN (%csvfile%) DO (
imapsync ^
  --host1 %%G --user1 %%H --password1 %%I ^
  --host2 %%J --user2 %%K --password2 %%L %%M  ...
)

You can add extra options inside this script, just after the variable %%M.
You can add extra options inside the file.txt, in the last column. Add 
an extra semicolon at the end (optional)
Example:
host001_1;user001_1;password001_1;host001_2;user001_2;password001_2;
host002_1;user002_1;password002_1;host002_2;user002_2;password002_2;
becomes
host001_1;user001_1;password001_1;host001_2;user001_2;password001_2; --automap --addheader
host002_1;user002_1;password002_1;host002_2;user002_2;password002_2; --automap --addheader

With this solution, options can be added, changed or removed per account.
Technically those options will go in %%M in the loop body 

Here is a complete Windows example ready to use: 
http://imapsync.lamiral.info/examples/sync_loop_windows.bat

Another solution to add extra arguments is to write another .bat that 
calls sync_loop_windows.bat with the extra arguments, like this
for example:

  sync_loop_windows.bat --automap --addheader --maxmessagespersecond 4 

Technically those options will go in %arguments%  in the loop body
of sync_loop_windows.bat


=======================================================================
Q. I have to migrate 500k users using 400 TB of disk space. 
   How do I proceed? How about speed?

R. Solution to this issue is two words: parallelism and measurements.  

Since all mailboxes are functionnaly independent, they can be processed 
independently, here comes parallelism, lunching several imapsync 
processes in parallel.

Meanwhile, mailboxes usually belong to the same server and syncs
share the same imapsync host via the same bandwidth, here come 
some limitations and bottlenecks.

How many syncs can we run in parallel? here comes measurements.

1) Measure the total transfer rate by adding each one printed in each run.
   Since adding this way is not so easy, just look at the overall 
   network rate of the imapsync host.

   On Linux, nload is good candidate to measure this overall 
   network rate, every 6 seconds, on eth0 interface, values in Kbytes:
   
     nload -t 6000 eth0 -u K

   Another excellent network tool is dstat:
   
     dstat -n -N eth0 6

   On Windows, get the overall network rate with the classical
   task manager (Ctrl-Alt-Sup), there is a network tab in it.
   Don't hesitate to send me free good tools to measure the
   overall transfer rate (the best would be one to sum up only 
   imap traffic but that's not mandatory at all).

2) Launch new parallel runs, one by one, as long as the total 
   transfer rate increase.

3) When the total transfer rate starts to diminish, stop new launches. 
   Note N as the number of parallel runs you got until then.

4) Only keep N-2 parallel runs for the future.


=======================================================================
Q. How to determine where is the bottleneck in an imapsync process?

R1. Divide and conquer.

In order to detect whether host1/link1 is the bottleneck or
host2/link2, we have several tests to explore:

1) run a sync from host1 to host1, with a host1 test account as destination.
This way, only host1+link1 are tested, host2 is not directly concerned.
If performances increase a lot then host2/link2 is the bottleneck.

2) run a sync from host2 to host2, with a host2 test account as destination.
This way, only host2+link2 are tested, host1 is not concerned.
If performances increase a lot then host1/link1 is the bottleneck.

If performances increase on both tests 1) and 2), I have no clue to explain that.
Same thing if they both decrease! 

R2. Isolating and overcoming bottlenecks

On any process involving several mechanisms, among all elements taking
part on the process there is always a bottleneck.  No one knows in
advance what is the first bottleneck. The first bottleneck has to be
determined, by measurements, not by guesses.  Once this first
bottleneck is known and overcome then the next bottleneck has to be
determined and overcome too, if needed. Repeat the process of looking
for the next bottleneck and its elimination until you estimate the
transfer rates, money costs and final dates are good enough to proceed
the whole huge migration.

Possible bottlenecks: 

- Throttles. 
  IMAP servers have artificial limits. 
  For example Gmail, Office365, Exchange have throttle limits.

- Bandwidth. 
  Usually available bandwidth is not a bottleneck. 
  Meanwhile, it can be a bottleneck on small Internet connexions.
  Imapsync downloads messages from host1 and upload messages to host2,
  consider this in case the connexion are asymetric.
  
- I/O on disks. 
  I/O are a classical bottleneck, almost always forgotten.
  Unlike CPU and RAM, Input/Output performances don't improve
  very much as time goes on so it's often a bottleneck.

- RAM memory.
  On all sides, monitor that your systems don't swap on disk,
  because swapping memory on disks decreases performance by 
  a factor of 20, at least.

- CPU.
  100% CPU during a whole transfer means the system is busy.
  Usually CPU is not a problem with imapsync but it can be a problem
  with one of the imap servers.
  Most often CPU is not the real bottleneck, I/O are.

Other possible bottlenecks:
- Number of hosts available to run imapsync processes.
- Imapsync itself.
- Errors management.
- MX domains, DNS.
- Money.
- Time.
- Bad luck.
- ...


=======================================================================
Q. Can I run more instances of imapsync in parallel on a Windows host?

R. Yes!

Q. Any performance issue?

You have to try and check the transfer rates, sum them up to
have a uniq numeric criteria. 
There is always a limit, depending on remote imap servers 
and the one running imapsync;
CPU, memory, Inputs/Outputs are the classical bottlenecks, 
the worst bottleneck is the winner that sets the limit.

REM ==== Parallel executions ====
REM If you want to do parallel runs of imapsync then this current script is a good start.
REM Just copy it several times and replace, on each copy, the csvfile variable value.
REM Instead of SET csvfile=file.txt write for example
REM SET csvfile=file01.txt in the first copy
REM then also 
REM SET csvfile=file02.txt in the second copy etc.
REM Of course you also have to split the data contained in file.txt
REM into file01.txt file02.txt etc.
REM After that, just double-click on each batch file to launch each process


=======================================================================
Q. I run multiple imapsync applications at the same time then get a
   warning "imapsync.pid already exists, overwriting it".
   Is this a potential problem when trying to sync multiple 
   IMAP account in parallel?

R1. No issue with the file imapsync.pid if you don't use its content
by yourself. 

This file can help you to manage multiple runs by sending signals 
to the processes (sigterm or sigkill) using their PID.
Each run can have its own pid file with --pidfile option.
The file imapsync.pid contains the PID of the current imapsync process.
This file is removed at the end of a normal run.
You can safely ignore the warning if you don't use imapsync.pid file
to manage imapsync processes.
