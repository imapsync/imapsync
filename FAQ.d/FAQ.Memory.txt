             Imapsync tips about memory issues.
=======================================================================


=======================================================================
Q. I got an "Out of memory" error message then imapsync crashes.
   How to fix that?

R0. Add option --debugmemory to debug memory issues.   

R1. It's probably a very big message on the host1 account.
   Before imapsync release 1.688 memory usage is at least 5 times 
   the biggest message size. then 2 times with release 1.688.
   So a 700 MB message will crunch 3.5 GB of memory.
   Starting with 1.688 it  will crunch 1.4 GB of memory.


R2. Usually "Out of memory" errors are related to old days,
   to old Mail::IMAPClient module releases, before 3.26.
   At that time memory usage was around 17 times the biggest message.
   Look at imapsync output first lines to get the Mail::IMAPClient 
   release used. Then upgrade Mail::IMAPClient Perl module if needed.
