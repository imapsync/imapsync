Now the questions again with their answers.

=======================================================================
Q. How to delete all emails of all folders of an account with imapsync?

R. Use the same account on both sides with option --delete1
   --noexpungeaftereach

Option --noexpungeaftereach is just to speed up the deletions.

Example:

  imapsync \
    --host1 test.lamiral.info --user1 foo --password1 secret \
    --host2 test.lamiral.info --user2 foo --password2 secret \
    --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach

=======================================================================
Q. How to delete all folders of an account with imapsync?

R. Use the same account on both sides with the options 
    --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach --delete1emptyfolders
    
  imapsync ... --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach --delete1emptyfolders

It won't delete the folder INBOX since INBOX is mandatory in imap.


=======================================================================
Q. How to delete some folders of an account with imapsync?

R. Use the same account on both sides with the options 
    --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach --delete1emptyfolders
    like when deleting all folders BUT select only the folders
    you want to delete by using options to select folders,
    like --folder or --folderrec or --include or --exclude 

Example, to delete the folder Blabla

  imapsync ... --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach --delete1emptyfolders --folder Blabla

To delete the four folders Kalender Kontakte Aufgaben Notizen:

  imapsync ... --include 'Kalender|Kontakte|Aufgaben|Notizen' \
                 --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach --delete1emptyfolders

I strongly recommend to use --dry first!

=======================================================================
Q. How to revert a sync that went to the wrong account?

R. If all the wrong emails have some common characteristic that is not
 shared by the good one, then you can search for them and delete them
 using the same account as source and destination. For example, if all
 the messages have the same email destination address as
 "john_smith@example.com", then you can remove them with the following
 command:
   
   imapsync ... --search "TO john_smith@example.com" --delete1 

 Be very careful with deletions! Since this section deals with something
 that was made wrong, you're in good place to make a new one!
 
 There is many possibilities to select messages with different criterium.
 See some of them by reading the document 
 https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Messages_Selection.txt

 If the wrongly emails messages synced have no special common 
 characteristic then take an handkerchief and cry.

=======================================================================
Q. How to delete emails older than 90 days with imapsync?

R. Use the same account on both sides with option --delete1
   --noexpungeaftereach --minage 90 

Example:

  imapsync \
    --host1 test.lamiral.info --user1 foo --password1 secret \
    --host2 test.lamiral.info --user2 foo --password2 secret \
    --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach --minage 90 

=======================================================================
Q. How to delete emails matching a certain criterium with imapsync?

R. Use the --search option to select the messages you want to delete 
   and then use the same account on both sides with the suplementary 
   options --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach
   To select the messages read the document FAQ.Messages_Selection.txt
   at https://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ.d/FAQ.Messages_Selection.txt


Example:

  imapsync \
    --host1 test.lamiral.info --user1 foo --password1 secret \
    --host2 test.lamiral.info --user2 foo --password2 secret \
    --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach --search "SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2010"

======================================================================
Q. Is there a way to delete the destination folders when the source 
   folders are no longer there?

R. Yes, use --delete2folders

 --delete2folders    : Delete folders in host2 that are not in host1.
                       For safety, first try it like this, it is safe:
                       --delete2folders --dry --justfolders --nofoldersizes
                       and see what folders will be deleted.

 --delete2foldersonly   reg : Delete only folders matching the regex reg.
                              Example: --delete2foldersonly "/^Junk$|^INBOX.Junk$/"
                              This option activates --delete2folders

 --delete2foldersbutnot reg : Do not delete folders matching the regex rex.
                              Example: --delete2foldersbutnot "/Tasks$|Contacts$|Foo$/"
                              This option activates --delete2folders
