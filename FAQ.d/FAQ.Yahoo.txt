                     Imapsync tips for Yahoo.
=======================================================================

Q. Synchronizing from Yahoo to XXX

R. Use --host1 imap.mail.yahoo.com --ssl1

./imapsync \
    --host1 imap.mail.yahoo.com \
    --user1 billy \
    --password1 secret \
    --ssl1 \
    --host2 XXX \
    --user2 billy \
    --password2 secret \
    --noabletosearch --errorsmax 10000 

SSL is mandatory for yahoo since November 2011.

Why increasing --errorsmax to 10000?
Because during the sync you may encounter several lines like this one:
- msg Inbox/12600 {0} S[36012] F[] I[27-Nov-2015 07:08:35 +0000] could not be fetched: 190 NO [UNAVAILABLE] UID FETCH Server error while fetching messages
- msg Inbox/12600 skipped.
I don't know why it happens, why Yahoo server says 
"NO [UNAVAILABLE] UID FETCH Server error while fetching messages"
Usually another run syncs the message successfully.

Why --noabletosearch option?
Yahoo IMAP does not honor well the SEARCH imap command (Dec 2017).
So don't use the --search option.
You can use --minage or/and --maxage but then add also --noabletosearch

Yahoo bandwidth per connexion is relatively low, 50 KiB/s to 500 KiB/s max, usually 100 KiB/s.
Consider using --useuid to speed up large accounts.


You also need to go to Yahoo, security and enable 
"Allow less secure apps to login", 
otherwise the login will not work. 

To enable less secure apps to login:
  * Login to the Yahoo mail account,
  * click on the account name or the avatar and select "Account Info",
  * click on "Account security",
  * turn off "Two steps verification"
  * turn on "Allow apps that use less secure authentication".​

Thanks to Eugen Mayer for this last point.

Another solution:

  * Login to the Yahoo mail account,
  * click on the account name or the avatar and select "Account Info",
  * click on "Account security",
  * Turn on "Two-step verification"
  * Click on "Manage app passwords" and 
    generate a specific password for imapsync, 
	choose "Other app" at the bottom and type imapsync
    since it is not in the predefined apps.
  * Use this password with imapsync.
