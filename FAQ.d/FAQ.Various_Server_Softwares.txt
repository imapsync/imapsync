         Imapsync tips for various imap server softwares.
=======================================================================



=======================================================================
Q. From Zimbra to XXX

imapsync ... \
	--exclude "Conversation Action Settings" \
	--exclude "Quick Step Settings" \
	--exclude "News Feed"

=======================================================================
Q. From or to HMailServer version 4.4.1.

R. You have to add prefix and separator manually because  4.4.1 doesn't
honor the NAMESPACE imap command.

Example for host1:

imapsync ... \
         --prefix1 "" --sep1 .

No specific option for HMailServer 5.3.3 since NAMESPACE is supported.

Maybe --subscribe_all will help you to see all migrated folders.


=======================================================================
Q. Synchronizing from Kerio Connect to XXX

R. No special options required.

=======================================================================
Q. from Microsoft's Exchange 2007 to Google Apps for your Domain 
   (GAFYD)

R. Take a look at:

=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from or to Parallels Plex Server

R. It depends on the OS

Parallells Plesk Panel for Windows requires --sep2 / --prefix2 ""
Parallells Plesk Panel for Linux works with default parameters.

=======================================================================
Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are under
   /home/user/mail but the tool copies everything in /home/user, how
   can i avoid that?

Two solutions:

R. Use
   imapsync ... --include '^mail'

R. or (better)
   imapsync ... --subscribed --subscribe


=======================================================================
Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are under
   /home/user/mail directory.  When imapsync creates the folders in
   the new cyrus imap server, it makes a folder "mail" and below that
   folder puts all the mail folders the user have in /home/user/mail,
   i would like to have all those folders directly under INBOX.

R. Use 
   imapsync ... --regextrans2 's/^mail/INBOX/' --dry
   look at the simulation and if all transformations seem
   good then remove the --dry option.


=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from Groupwise to Cyrus

R. By Jamie Neil:

I eventually managed to get the mail to migrate without errors using the 
following options:

--sep1 /
  - doesn't report separator so has to be set explicitly.

--nosyncacls
  - doesn't support ACLs.

--skipheader '^Content-Type'
  - MIME separator IDs seem to change every time a mail is accessed so 
    this is required to stop duplicates.

--maxage 3650
  - some messages just don't seem to want to transfer and produce the 
    perl errors I mentioned before. This prevents the errors, but the
    bad messages don't transfer.

Even though the mail migrated OK, there are a couple of gotchas with 
Groupwise IMAP:

1) Some of the GW folders are not real folders and are not available
to IMAP, the main problem one being "Sent Items". I could find no way
of coping the contents of these folders. The nearest I got was to
create a "real" folder and copy/move the sent items into it, but
imapsync still didn't see the messages (I think because there is
something funny about the reported dates/sizes).

It think this problem has been rectified in GW6.5.

2) The "skipheader '^Content-Type'" directive is required to stop 
duplicate messages being created. GW seems to generate this field on
the fly for messages that have MIME separators and so it's different
every time.

3) Version 6.0.1 of the Groupwise Internet Connector sucks. I was 
getting server aborts when I pushed it a bit hard! I eventually had to
upgrade to 6.0.4 which seems to be a lot more stable.


=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from iPlanet Messaging Server
5.2 Patch 2 (built Jul 14 2004)) to Groupwise 7.0
I encounter many errors like this:
"Error trying to append string: 17847 BAD APPEND"

R. GroupWise 7 seems buggy. Apply GroupWise 7 support pack 1

=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from David Tobit V10 (DvISE Mail Access Server MA-...)

R. Use the following options:

imapsync ... --prefix1 ""    --sep1 /  --idatefromheader ^
             --nofoldersizes --useuid --nocheckmessageexists

=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from David Tobit V8
   ("* OK IMAP4rev1 DvISE Mail Access Server MA-8.10a (0126)")

First try above V10 solution since improvments have been made
to support Tobit.

R. Use the following options :
imapsync ... --prefix1 INBOX. --sep1 / --subscribe --subscribed 

=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from Tobit David Server 6 
   ("DvISE Mail Access Server MA-6.60a (0118)")

First try above V10 solution since improvments have been made
to support Tobit.

R. Look at the discussion:
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync_list/msg00582.html
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync_list/threads.html#00582
patch saved in ./patches/imapsync-1.337_tobit_V6.patch

=======================================================================
Q. I need to migrate 1250 mailboxes, passwords are in a MySQL Database.
Can you tell me if your script suits my needs?

R. Mailboxes must exist before running imapsync.
You have to extract users logins and passwords in a csv file.
See the "HUGE MIGRATION" section in the README file.


======================================================================
Q: From MailEnable 1.75
R: --sep1 "/" --prefix1 ""

Q: From MailEnable 2.2
R: --sep1 "." --prefix1 ""

Q: To MailEnable
R: --sep2 / --prefix2 "" --addheader --messageidnodomain --syncflagsaftercopy

======================================================================
Q. From GMX IMAP4 StreamProxy
R. Use:
   --prefix1 INBOX and --sep1 .

======================================================================
Q. From Courier to Archiveopteryx
R. You can read http://www.archiveopteryx.org/migration/imapsync
   Default values might be fine now with latest imapsync.

======================================================================
Q. To Sun Java(tm) System Messaging Server 6.2-7.05
Q. To Communigate Pro - Solaris version

R. See and run patches/imapsync_1.267_jari


======================================================================
Q. From Softalk Workgroup Mail 7.6.4 

R. Old Softalk releases don't support the IMAP SEARCH command.
   Here are the options to get it working.

imapsync ... --sep1 '.' --prefix1 '' \
             --noabletosearch1  --nocheckmessageexists --addheader

(Thanks to Andrew Tucker)

======================================================================
Q. From or to QQMail IMAP4Server

R. imapsync ... --noabletosearch1

======================================================================
Q. From FirstClass to XXX
   http://www.firstclass.com/

R. Migrating from FirstClass is not easy because FirstClass, strangely, 
   does not show all messages via IMAP. To make it show all messages,
   a trick, painful to follow by hand, is moving emails 
   out and back in, for each folder. May be it can be done by a script.

  FirstClass releases prior to release 12 do not shows the "Sent" 
  folder in IMAP but FirstClass release 12 shows it.
  I advice you to upgrade to FirstClass release 12 before leaving it
  with imapsync or another imap tool.

Here is a command line used to migrate from FirtClass release 12:

  imapsync ... \
    --tmpdir /var/tmp --usecache \
    --useheader Message-ID \
    --idatefromheader \
    --addheader \
    --regextrans2 "s,(/|^) +,\$1,g" --regextrans2 "s, +(/|$),\$1,g" \
    --regextrans2 "s/[\^]/_/g"       \
    --regextrans2 "s/['\"\\\\]/_/g"  \
    --regextrans2 "s,&AC8-,-,g" \
    --regextrans2 "s,&APg-,oe,g" 

On Windows:
  imapsync.exe ... ^
    --automap ^
    --usecache ^
    --useheader Message-ID ^
    --idatefromheader ^
    --addheader ^
    --regextrans2 "s,(/|^) +,$1,g" ^
    --regextrans2 "s, +(/|$),$1,g" ^
    --regextrans2 "s/[\^]/_/g" ^
    --regextrans2 "s/['\\]/_/g" ^
    --regextrans2 "s,^&AC8-,-,g"  ^
    --regextrans2 "s,^&APg-,oe,g"

======================================================================
Q. From XXX to FTGate

R. Do NOT use --usecache since new UIDs are not given by FTGate and also
   badly guessed by imapsync. UIDEXPUNGE does not work so use also
   --expunge2 when using --delete2
  
  imapsync ... \
     --sep2 / --prefix2 "" \
     --useheader Message-Id \
