              Imapsync and user concurrent access.
=======================================================================

Q. What happens if a user access the mailbox during the transfer process?

R. Think all potential problems with a sync between
   a master/source/host1 and a slave/destination/host2

What happens when a user access syncing accounts depends
on what he does, where he does and when:

* Reading: no problem anywhere, anytime.

* Writing at source/host1:
  * adding folder => will need a resync after
  * deleting folder => deletion not synced unless --delete2folders
  * deleting message => deletion not synced unless --delete2
  * adding message => will need a resync
  * message flag change => will need a resync

* Writing at destination/host2:
  * adding folder => no problem, unless --delete2folders is used
  * deleting folder => might reappear by the sync
  * adding message => no problem, unless --delete2 is used
  * deleting message => might reappear by the sync
  * message flag change => might be canceled by the sync
