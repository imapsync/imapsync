| FAQ for imapsync |
+------------------+

http://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ

Unix versus Windows syntax.

A) \ versus ^

On Unix shells you can write a single command on multiple lines
by using the escape character \ at the end of each line 
(except the last one). On Windows this character is ^

Unix example:

./imapsync \
   --host1 imap.truc.org --user1 foo --password1 secret1 \
   --host2 imap.trac.org --user2 bar --password2 secret2


Windows example:

imapsync ^
   --host1 imap.truc.org --user1 foo --password1 secret1 ^
   --host2 imap.trac.org --user2 bar --password2 secret2


Of course you can write the command on one only line without 
characters \ nor ^. I use them because the output is
better, no truncation, pretty print. It's just sugar.

In this FAQ I use \ for examples. Transcript to ^ if
you're on a Windows system.

B) ' versus " 

On Windows the single quote character ' doesn't work
like on Unix so in the examples of this FAQ the 
command containing single quotes ' will fail on Windows.
To fix it just replace single quotes ' by double quotes "

Thank you for your participation.

=======================================================================
Q. I need to migrate hundred accounts, how can I do?

R. If you have many mailboxes to migrate think about a little
shell program. Write a file called file.txt (for example)
containing users and passwords.
The separator used in this example is ';'

The file.txt file contains:

user001_1;password001_1;user001_2;password001_2
user002_1;password002_1;user002_2;password002_2
user003_1;password003_1;user003_2;password003_2
user004_1;password004_1;user004_2;password004_2
user005_1;password005_1;user005_2;password005_2
...

On Unix the shell program can be:

 { while IFS=';' read  u1 p1 u2 p2; do 
	imapsync --host1 imap.side1.org --user1 "$u1" --password1 "$p1" \
                 --host2 imap.side2.org --user2 "$u2" --password2 "$p2" ...
 done ; } < file.txt

On Windows the batch program can be:

  FOR /F "tokens=1,2,3,4 delims=; eol=#" %%G IN (file.txt) DO imapsync ^
  --host1 imap.side1.org --user1 %%G --password1 %%H ^
  --host2 imap.side2.org --user2 %%I --password2 %%J ...

The ... can be replaced by nothing or any supplementary imapsync option.

=======================================================================
Q. Where I can find old imapsync releases?

R. Search the internet.

=======================================================================
Q. Where I can find free open and gratis imapsync releases?

R. Search the internet.

Q. Is is legal?

R. Yes, the license permits it
   http://imapsync.lamiral.info/COPYING

=======================================================================
Q. I use --useuid which uses a cache in /tmp or --tmpdir, the hostnames
   host1 or host2 has changed but mailboxes are the same. Will imapsync
   generate duplicate messages on next runs?

R. Yes

Q. How can I fix this?

R. The cache path reflects hostnames or ip adresses, just change the
   directory names of host1 or host2. Use --dry to see if next runs
   will generate duplucates.
   By default the cache is like 

   /tmp/imapsync_cache/host1/user1/host2/user2/...

=======================================================================
Q. How can I speed up transfers?

R. By using --useuid imapsync avoid getting messages headers and build
   a cache. On Unix a good thing is to add also --tmpdir /var/tmp
   to keep the cache since /tmp is often cleared on reboot.

   imapsync ... --useuid 

R. Add also --nofoldersizes since the default behavior is to compute
   folder sizes. Folder sizes are useless for the transfer, just 
   useful to see what has to be done on each folder.

=======================================================================
Q. I see warning messages like 
"Host1 Sent/15 size 1428 ignored (no header so we ignore this message)"
What can I do to transfer those messages?

R1. Use --addheader option, it will add a header like
   "Message-Id: <15@imapsync>" and transfer the message on host2.
   Duplicates won't happen in next runs.

   imapsync ... --addheader

R2. Use --useuid then imapsync will avoid dealing with headers.

   imapsync ... --useuid

=======================================================================
Q. How can I try imapsync with the new Mail::IMAPClient 3.xx perl library?

R. - Download latest Mail::IMAPClient 3.xx at
   http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-IMAPClient/
   - untar it anywhere:
        tar xzvf Mail-IMAPClient-3.xx.tar.gz

   - Get any imapsync (latest is better).

   - run imapsync with perl and -I option tailing to use the perl
     module Mail-IMAPClient-3.xx. Example:

         perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-3.30/lib  ./imapsync ...

     or if imapsync is in directory /path/
        perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-3.30/lib   /path/imapsync ...

   - Look at the script named i3 in the tarball, it can be used to
     run imapsync with included Mail-IMAPClient-3.30/ wherever you 
     unpacked the imapsync tarball


=======================================================================
Q. How can I use imapsync with Mail::IMAPClient 2.2.9 perl module?

R. - Download Mail::IMAPClient 2.2.9 at 
   http://search.cpan.org/~djkernen/Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9/
   http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DJ/DJKERNEN/Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9.tar.gz
   - untar it anywhere:
        tar xzvf Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9.tar.gz

   - run imapsync with perl and -I option tailing to use Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9:
        perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9  ./imapsync [...]

     or if imapsync is in directory /path/
        perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9  /path/imapsync [...]

   - Look at the script named i2 in the tarball, it can be used to
     run imapsync with included Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9/ wherever you 
     unpacked the imapsync tarball


=======================================================================
Q. Can I use imapsync to migrate emails from pop3 server to imap server?

R1. No. 
You can migrate emails from pop server to imap server with pop2imap:
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/pop2imap/

R2. Yes 
Many pop3 servers runs in parallel with an imap server on the
exactly the same mailboxes. They serve the same INBOX
(imap serves INBOX and several other folders, pop3 serves only INBOX)
So have a try with imapsync on the same host1.

=======================================================================
Q. I am interested in creating  a local clone of the IMAP on a LAN 
server for  faster synchronisations, email will always be delivered 
to the remote server and so the synchronisation will be one way - from 
remote to local. How suited is imapsync for continuous one-way 
synchronisation of mailboxes? Is there a better solution?

R. If messages are delivered remotely and you play locally with the
copy, in order to have fast access, then the synchronisation can't
be one way. You may change flags, you may move messages in 
different folders etc.

A better tool with this scenario is offlineimap, 
designed for this issue, and faster than imapsync.

=======================================================================
Q. We have found that the sent time and date have been changed to the 
   time at which the file was synchronised. 

R. This is the case with:
   - Eudora
   - Zimbra
   - Outlook 2003
   - Gmail
   but not with 
   - Mutt
   - Thunderbird

Eurora shows by default  the time the imap server received the email. I
think   it is  quite   a  wrong  behavior  since  the messages can have
travelled some time before the reception.

The sent time and date are given by the "Date:" header and it is set
most of the time by the MUA (Mail User Agent, Mutt, Eudora,
Thunderbird etc.).

imapsync does not touch any byte of messages unless told to do so
by an option. Messages on both parts should be identical
(some IMAP servers add or even change header lines).

Solutions: 
a) Use the --syncinternaldates option and keep using Eudora.
   But --syncinternaldates is now turn on by default so if you 
   encounter the issue then the solution is harder, depending
   on email client softwares and IMAP server softwares.

b) use --idatefromheader to set the internal dates on host2 same as the 
   "Date:" headers. It won't work if a) doesn't work.

c) In Maildir boxes, after the sync (too late...), use the script
learn/adjust_time.pl to change the internal dates from the "Date:" header.
(this a Unix fix using touch command)

d) Use a better email client or configure it in order it sorts messages
by sent date.


=======================================================================
Q. imapsync calculates 479 messages in a folder but only transfers 400 
   messages. What's happen?

R1. Unless --useuid is used, imapsync considers a header part 
   of a message to identify a message on both sides.
   The header part is whole header with "--useheader ALL" or
   only specific lines depending on --useheader --skipheader
   or default values.

Consequences:

  1) Duplicate messages (identical header) are not transferred
     several times.

The result is that you can have more messages on host1 than on host2.

R2. With option --useuid imapsync doesn't use headers to identify
messages on both sides but it uses their imap uid. In that case
duplicates on host1 are transfered on host2.

=======================================================================
Q. I need to log every output on a file named log.txt

R. Use redirections of both standard and error outputs "> log.txt 2>&1"

  imapsync ... > log.txt 2>&1

=======================================================================
Q. I need to log every output on a file named log.txt and also to the 
   screen in order to keep seeing what's going on during execution

R. Use the tee program (also available on Windows)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_%28command%29

  imapsync ...  2>&1 | tee log.txt

=======================================================================
Q.  I run multiple imapsync applications at the same time then get a
    warning "imapsync.pid already exists, overwriting it".
    Is this a potential problem when trying to sync multiple 
    IMAP account in parallel?

R1. No issue with the file imapsync.pid if you don't use its content
by yourself. 

This file can help you to manage multiple runs by sending signals 
to the processes (sigterm or sigkill) using their PID.
Each run can have its own pid file with --pidfile option.
The file imapsync.pid contains the PID of the imapsync process.
This file is removed at the end of a normal run.
You can safely ignore the warning if you don't use imapsync.pid file.

=======================================================================
Q. Couldn't create [INBOX.Ops/foo/bar]: NO Invalid mailbox name: 
INBOX.Ops/foo/bar 

Let begin by an explanation.

Example:
sep1 = /
sep2 = .

imapsync reverts each separator automaticaly. 

a) All / character coming from host1 are converted to . (convert the separator)
b) All . character coming from host1 are converted to / (to avoid 
intermediate unwanted folder creation). 

So 
INBOX/Ops.foo.bar (Ops.foo.bar is just one folder name) will be translated to 
INBOX.Ops/foo/bar 

Sometimes the sep1 character is not valid on host2 (character "/" usualy)

R. Try :

  --regextrans2 "s,/,X,g"

It'll convert / character to X 
Choose X as you wish: _ or SEP or 
any string (including the empty string).


=======================================================================
Q. The option --subscribe does not seem to work

R1. Use it with --subscribed

R2. There is also the --subscribe_all option that subscribe
to all folders on host2.

=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync retain the \Answered and $Forwarded flags?

R. It depends on the destination server.

a) If the destination server honors the "PERMAENTFLAGS \*" 
directive (meaning it accepts any flag) or no PERMAENTFLAGS at all 
then imapsync synchronises all flags except the \Recent flag
(RFC 3501 says about \Recent flag "This flag can not be 
altered by the client.").

b) If the destination server honors the "PERMAENTFLAGS without the 
special "\*"  then imapsync synchronises only the flags listed 
in PERMANENTFLAGS.

Some imap servers have problems with flags not beginning with
the backslash character \ 
(see next question to find a solution to this issue)


=======================================================================
Q. How to convert flags?

R. use --regexflag
For example to convert flag IMPORTANT to flag CANWAIT

  imapsync ... --regexflag "s/IMPORTANT/CANWAIT/g" --debugflags

option --debugflags is usefull to see in details what imapsync
does with flags.

=======================================================================
Q. How to convert flags with $ to \ character?

R. $ and \ are special characters we have to "escape" them.
For example to convert flag $label1 to \label1

  imapsync ... --regexflag 's/\$label1/\\label1/g' --debugflags

=======================================================================
Q. I need to keep only a defind list of flags, how can I do?
The destination imap server complains about bad flags (Exchange).

R1. Recent imapsync deals with this issue by filter with PERMANENTFLAGS
automatically.

R2. For example if you want to keep only the following flags
\Seen \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft
then use these magic --regexflag options (thanks to Phil):

 --regexflag 's/.*?(?:(\\(?:Answered|Flagged|Deleted|Seen|Draft)\s?)|$)/defined($1)?$1:q()/eg'

Analysis is left to the reader.

This one is longer and may be use with old perl (no /e regex extension):
 --regexflag 's/(.*)/$1 jrdH8u/' \
 --regexflag 's/.*?(\\Seen|\\Answered|\\Flagged|\\Deleted|\\Draft|jrdH8u)/$1 /g' \
 --regexflag 's/(\\Seen|\\Answered|\\Flagged|\\Deleted|\\Draft|jrdH8u) (?!(\\Seen|\\Answered|\\Flagged|\\Deleted|\\Draft|jrdH8u)).*/$1 /g' \
 --regexflag 's/jrdH8u *//'


======================================================================
Q. imapsync fails with the following error:
flags from : [\Seen NonJunk]["10-Aug-2006 13:00:30 -0400"]
Error trying to append string: 58 NO APPEND Invalid flag list

R. For some servers, flags have to begin with a \ character.
The flag "NonJunk" may be a invalid flag for your server 
so use for example:

imapsync ...    --regexflag "s/NonJunk//g"

Remark (thanks to Arnt Gulbrandsen): 
IMAP system flags have to begin with \ character.
Any other flag must begin with another character.
System flags are just flags defined by an RFC instead of by users.
Conclusion, some imap server coders don't read the RFCs (so do I).

Recent imapsync deals with this issue by filter with PERMANENTFLAGS
automatically.

=======================================================================
Q. Flags are not well synchonized. Is it a bug?

R. It happens with some servers on the first sync. 
Also, it was a bug from revision 1.200 to revision 1.207

Solution: run imapsync a second time. imapsync synchronizes flags
on each run.

=======================================================================
Q. On Unix, some passwords contain * and " characters. Login fails.
R. Use a backslash to escape the characters:

    imapsync ... --password1 \"password\" 

It works for the star * character,
I don't know if it works for the " character.

=======================================================================
Q. On Windows, some passwords contain $ characters. Login fails.
R1. Enclose passwords between ""

    imapsync ... --password1 "zzz$zz$$z"

R2. Prefix each $ character with a ^ since ^ is the escape character
    on Windows

    imapsync ... --password1 zzz^$zz^$^$z

For a password that is exactly the 8 characters string $%&<>|^"
you have to enter

    imapsync ... --password1 "$%%&<>|^"^"

=======================================================================
Q. On Windows, some passwords begin with an equal = character. 
   Login fails. What can I do?

R. Use twice equals == characters instead; For example, if =secret 
   is the password then use:

    imapsync ... --password1 ==secret

or even

    imapsync ... --password1 "==secret"

=======================================================================
Q. With huge account (many messages) when it comes to reading the
destination server it comes out this error:
"To   Folder [INBOX.foobar] Not connected" 
What can I do?

R. May be spending too much time on the source server, the connection 
timed out on the destination server.
Try options --nofoldersizes 


=======================================================================
Q. imapsync failed with a "word too long" error from the imap server,
   What can I do?

R. Use imapsync release 1.172 or at least 1.166 with options
   --split1 500 --split2 500
   or a old old imapsync (before 1.94)

=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync support IMAP over TLS (IMAPS)?

R. Yes natively since release 1.161. 
still, 2 ways, at least :

a) Use --ssl1 and/or --ssl2 options

--ssl1 tells imapsync to use ssl on host1
--ssl2 tells imapsync to use ssl on host2


b) Use stunnel
   http://www.stunnel.org/
   Assuming there is an imaps (993) server on imap.foo.org,
   on your localhost machine (or bar machine) run :
       stunnel -c -d imap -r imap.foo.org:imaps
   or using names instead of numbers 
       stunnel -c -d 143 -r imap.foo.org:993
   then use imapsync on localhost (or bar machine) imap (143) port.


=======================================================================
Q: How to have an imaps server?

R. 
a) Install one 

b) or use stunnel :
   Assuming there is an imap (143) server on localhost
        stunnel  -d 993 -r 143 -f

c) or use stunnel on inetd
   imaps stream  tcp nowait cyrus /usr/sbin/stunnel -s cyrus -p /etc/ssl/certs/imapd.pem -r localhost:imap2

=======================================================================
Q: I'm trying to use imapsync on win32 for gmail and it requires ssl.
Imapsync appears to require IO::Socket::SSL. What can I do?

R1: use standalone imapsync.exe, it contains IO::Socket::SSL 
Perl module embeded.

R2: IO::Socket::SSLio-socket-ssl is available on Win32 
with Strawberry Perl.

=======================================================================
Q: Multiple copies when I run imapsync twice ore more.

R1. You can use option --useuid, imapsync then won't use header lines to
compare messages in folders. Keep in ming it uses a local cache.

  imapsync ... --useuid

R2. Multiple copies of the emails on the destination server. Some IMAP
servers (Domino for example) add some headers for each message
transfered. The message is transfered again and again each time you
run imapsync. This is bad of course. The explanation is that imapsync
considers the message is not the same since headers have changed (one
line added) and size too (the header part). 

You can look at the headers found by imapsync by using the --debug
option (and search for the message on both part), Header lines from
the source server begin with a "FH:" prefix, Header lines from the
destination server begin with a "TH:" prefix. Since --debug is very
verbose I suggest to isolate a email in a specific folder in case you
want to forward me the output.

The way to avoid this problem is by using options --skipheader and
--skipsize, like this (avoid headers beginning whith the string "X-"):

 imapsync ... --skipheader '^X-' --skipsize

To skip several headers you can use --skipheader one time

 imapsync ... --skipheader '^X-|^Status|^Bcc'

If you think you have too many header to avoid just use

 imapsync ... --useheader 'Message-ID' --skipsize

Remark. (Trick found by Tomasz Kaczmarski)

Option --useheader 'Message-ID' asks the server to send only header
lines begining with 'Message-ID'.  Some (buggy) servers send the whole
header (all lines) instead of the 'Message-ID' line. In that case, a
trick to keep the --useheader filtering behavior is to use
--skipheader with a negative lookahead pattern :

 imapsync ... --skipheader '^(?!Message-ID)' --skipsize

 Read it as "skip every header except Message-ID".

======================================================================
Q. I am transferring mails from one IMAP server to another. I am using
   an SSL connection. Transferring huge mails (>10MB) takes ages.

R. try to transfer the mails without SSL connection. SSL code outside
   imapsync uses a memory buffer, which gets increased upon reading of
   mails by 4096 bytes. This creates a huge load on the host imapsync
   runs on by copying the memory buffers for every 4096 byte step.
   This does not occur without SSL.

(Written by Stefan Schmidt)

======================================================================
Q. What are --subscribe and --subscribed for, and how can they be used?

R. In the IMAP protocol each user can subscribe to one or more folders.
   Then he can configure its email software to just see his subscribed
   folders list. That's an IMAP feature.

   Knowing that, the imapsync help says:

  imapsync --help
  ...
  --subscribed           : transfers subscribed folders.
  --subscribe            : subscribe to the folders transferred on the 
                           host2 that are subscribed on host1.
  --subscribe_all        : subscribe to the folders transferred on the 
                           host2 even if they are not subscribed on host1.


======================================================================
Q. I want to exclude a folder hierarchy like "public"

R. Use:

--exclude '^public\.'
or maybe
--exclude '^"public\.'

In the example given the character "." is the folder separator, you
can ommit it. Just take the string as it appears on the imapsync
output line :

From folders list : [INBOX] [public.dreams] [etc.]

======================================================================
Q. I want to exclude only INBOX

R. Use:

  imapsync ... --exclude '^INBOX$' 

A good way to see what will be done is to first use:

  imapsync ...  --exclude '^INBOX$' --justfolders --nofoldersizes --dry


======================================================================
Q. I want the --folder 'MyFolder' option be recursive.

Two solutions:

R1. Use

--folderrec 'MyFolder'

R2. Use --include '^MyFolder'
   Then the folder "MyFolder" and all its subfolders will be handled
   and only them.


======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from or to Exchange 2003 with an admin/authuser 
   account?

R. Thomas Edgar wrote the following

In case you can glean something from this snippet which allowed us 
to migrate from Exchange 2003 t0 Cyrus Imap 2.4 (you would reverse 
the flow to go the other way):

  imapsync --dry --host1 ExchangeServer.mycompany.com \
    --user1 Some.User@mycompany.com --authuser1 ExchangeAdminAccount \
    --proxyauth1 --password1 '$pass_with_dollars$' \
    --host2 cyrusimapbackend.mycompany.com \
    --user2 SameOrDiffererentUser@mycompany.com \
    --authuser2 CyrusAdminAccount --proxyauth2

We also needed to:

- Ensure the Exchange Admin Acct had IMAP4 enabled in it's 
  profile (it initially didn't!)
- Ensure the Some.User Exchange Acct had IMAP4 enabled 
  in it's profile (it initially didn't!)
- Add the CyrusAdminAccount to admins line in /etc/imapd.conf
- Give CyrusAdminAccount lrswipkxtecda to the Cyrus Imap account 
  being migrated to (- or in your case, from)

In case you are not aware:

- It will prompt for a password if you don't supply it
- the domain part of the fully-qualified email could be 
  omitted in our case
- Use --debugimap when testing initial connectivity, if necessary


======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from or to Exchange 2007/2010 with an 
   admin/authuser account?
   
R. The tricks comes from Michele Marcionelli and Benjamin Priestman:

This doesn't work:
  imapsync ... --user2 user2 --authuser2 admin2 --password2 adminpassword2 ...

This might works:
  imapsync ... --user2 'domain\admin2\user2' --password2 adminpassword2 ...
or 
  imapsync ... --user2 'admin2@domain\user2' --password2 adminpassword2 ...

where "domain" is set be the user's UPN in Active Directory
or the NETBIOS or DNS name of the domain.

The exact format might vary depending on local configuration and you
should experiment with the different formats.

======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from uw-imap with an admin/authuser account?

R. Use 

--user1="user*admin_user" --password1 "admin_user_password"


======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from cyrus with an admin account?

R. Use 
--authuser1 admin_user  ----password1 admin_user_password \
 --user1 foo_user --ssl1

In this case, --authmech1 PLAIN will be used by default since it
is the only way to go for now. So don't use --authmech1 SOMETHING
with --authuser1 admin_user, it will not work.
Same behavior with the --authuser2 option.

Do not forget the option --ssl1 since PLAIN auth is only
supported with ssl encryption most of the time. But it can
work without --ssl1 if PLAIN is permitted in normal use.

Here is an example:
 imapsync \
	--host1 server1 \
	--user1 joe \
	--authuser1 AdminAccount \
	--password1 AdminAccountPassword \
	--ssl1 \

======================================================================
Q: How to migrate from Sun Java Enterprise System / Sun One / iPlanet /
Netscape servers with an admin account?

R: Those imap servers don't allow the typical use of --authuser1 to use an
administrative account. They expect the use of an IMAP command called
proxyauth that is issued after login in as an administrative account.

For example, consider the administrative account 'administrator' and your
real user 'real_user'. The IMAP sequence would be:

  OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 ACL QUOTA LITERAL+ NAMESPACE UIDPLUS
  CHILDREN BINARY UNSELECT LANGUAGE STARTTLS XSENDER X-NETSCAPE XSERVERINFO
  AUTH=PLAIN] imap.server IMAP4 service (Sun Java(tm) System Messaging
  Server ...))
  1 LOGIN administrator password
  1 OK User logged in
  2 PROXYAUTH real_user
  2 OK Completed

In imapsync, you can achieve this by using the following options:

  --host1 source.imap.server \
  --user1 real_user \
  --authuser1 administrator \
  --proxyauth1 \
  --passfile admin.txt

======================================================================
Q. Is there anyway of making imapsync purge the destination folder
   when the source folder is deleted?

R. No, that's too dangerous. May be coded in future release.

But if the source folder is empty (not deleted) and options --delete2
--expunge2 are used then the destination folder will be empty.

======================================================================
Q. Is it possible to synchronize all messages from one server to 
another without recreating the folder structure and the target server.

R. Yes.

For example, to synchronize all messages in all forders on host1
to folder INBOX only on host2:

1) First try (safe mode):

imapsync \
 ...
 --regextrans2 's/(.*)/INBOX/' \
 --dry --justfolders

2) See if the output says everything you want imapsync to do, 
   --dry option is safe and does nothing real.
   
3) Remove --dry 
   Check the imap folder tree on the target side, you should
   only have one: the classical INBOX.

4) Remove --justfolders


======================================================================
Q. I have moved from Braunschweig to Graz, so I would like to have my
   whole Braunschweig mail sorted into a subfolder INBOX.Braunschweig 
   of my new mail account.

R.
1) First try (safe mode):

imapsync \
 ...
 --regextrans2 's/INBOX(.*)/INBOX.Braunschweig$1/' \
 --dry --justfolders

2) See if the output says everything you want imapsync to do, 
   --dry option is safe and does nothing real.
   
3) Remove --dry 
   Check the imap folder tree on the target side

4) Remove --justfolders

=======================================================================
Q. Give examples about --regextrans2

R. --regextrans2 is used to transform folder names

Remember that --regextrans2 applies after the default 
inversion prefix1 <-> prefix2 and sep1 <-> sep2

Examples: 

0) First try with --dry --justfolders options since imapsync shows the
   transformations it will do without really doing them. Then when
   happy with the output remove the --dry --justfolders options.

1) To remove INBOX. in the name of destination folders:

    --regextrans2 's/^INBOX\.(.+)/$1/'

2) To sync a complete account in a subfolder called FOO:
  
  a) Seperator is dot character "." and "INBOX" prefixes every folder
  
    --regextrans2 's/^INBOX(.*)/INBOX.FOO$1/'

  or:
  
  b) Seperator is slash character "/" and there is no prefix 
  
   --regextrans2 's#(.*)#FOO/$1#'
   
   or:

  c) Any separator, any prefix solution, FOO is the subfolder:

  It is a complicated line because every case is taken into account.
  Type it in one line (or with the \ at the end of first line on Unix shells.
   
   --regextrans2 's,${h2_prefix}(.*),${h2_prefix}FOO${h2_sep}$1,' \
   --regextrans2 's,^INBOX$,${h2_prefix}FOO{h2_sep}INBOX,'


3) to substitute all characters dot "." by underscores "_"
    --regextrans2 's/\./_/g'

4) to change folder names like this:
[mail/Sent Items] -> [Sent]
[mail/Test]       -> [INBOX/Test]
[mail/Test2]      -> [INBOX/Test2]

    --regextrans2 's#^mail/Sent Items$#Sent#' \
    --regextrans2 's#^mail/#INBOX/#'

=======================================================================
Q. I would like to move emails from InBox to a sub-folder called,
   say "2010-INBOX" based on the date (Like all emails received in the
   Year 2010 should be moved to the folder called "2010-INBOX").

R. 2 ways :

a) Manually:
------------

1) You create a folder INBOX.2010-INBOX

2) Mostly every email software allow sorting by date. In INBOX, you
   select from 1 january to 31 december 2010 messages with the shift key.
   (in mutt, use ~d)

3) Cut/paste in INBOX.2010-INBOX

b) With imapsync:
-----------------

imapsync ... \
--search 'SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2010 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2010'
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX$/INBOX.2010-INBOX/' \
--folder INBOX

=======================================================================
Q. I want to play with headers line and --regexmess but I want to leave
   the body as is

R. The header/body separation is a blank line so an example:
   --regexmess 's{\A(.*?(?! ^$))^Date:(.*?)$}{$1Date:$2\nX-Date:$2}gxms'

Will replace (HeaderBegin and HeaderEnd are not part of the header)

HeaderBegin
Message-ID: <499EF800.4030002@blabla.fr>
Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
From: Gilles LAMIRAL <lamiral@linux-france.org>
HeaderEnd

by

HeaderBegin
Message-ID: <499EF800.4030002@blabla.fr>
Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
X-Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
From: Gilles LAMIRAL <lamiral@linux-france.org>
HeaderEnd

This example just add an header line "X-Date:" based on "Date:" line.

=======================================================================
Q. My imap server does not accept a message and warns
   "Invalid header". What is the problem?

R. You fall in the classical mbox versus Maildir/ format
   problem. May be you use a misconfigured procmail rule.

A header beginning like the following one is in the mbox
format, header line 1 has no colon behind "From", header
lines 2 through N do have a colon :

From foo@yoyo.org  Sat Jun 22 01:10:21 2002
Return-Path: <foo@yoyo.org>
Received: ...

Any Maildir/ configured imap server may refuse this message since its
header is invalid. The first "From " line is not valid. It lacks a
colon character ":". To solve this issue you have several solutions

a) Remove manually this first "From " line for each message before
   using imapsync. 

b) Replace manually the whitespace by a colon in string "From " but you
   might end with two "From:" lines (just have a look at the other 
   header lines of the message)

c) Run imapsync with the following option (this replaces "From "by "From:"):
   --regexmess 's/\AFrom /From:/'

or may be better (no other "From:" collision):

d) Run imapsync with the following option (this replaces "From "by "X-om:"):
   --regexmess 's/\AFrom /X-om:/'

e) Run imapsync with the following option (this removes the whole "From " line):
   --regexmess 's{\AFrom\ [^\n]*(\n)?}{}gxms'

Solution e) is solution a) made by imapsync itself.
Solutions c) and d) keep "From " lines information
(normally it's useless to keep them)

Best solutions are e) or d).

=======================================================================
Q. The contact folder isn't well copied. 
   How to copy the contact folder?

R. Forget the destination server (choose the same)
Change the script around line 1426
       # ITSD
       $new_id = $from->copy($t_fold,$f_msg);
       #$new_id = $to->append_string($t_fold,$string, $flags_f, $d);

and tried a copy of the mail instead an append_string. Because we are
using the same server, we can use $from->copy Therefore we seem to not
download and upload the message and therefore we do not have any
format issues. And now it works fine. (Thanks to Hansjoerg.Maurer)

=======================================================================
Q. From or to HMailServer version 4.4.1.

R. You have to add prefix and separator manually because  4.4.1 doesn't
honor the NAMESPACE imap command.

Example for host1:

imapsync ... \
         --prefix1 "" --sep1 .

No specific option for HMailServer 5.3.3 since NAMESPACE is supported.

Maybe --subscribe_all will help you to see all migrated folders.


=======================================================================
Q. Synchronising from SmarterMail to XXX

imapsync --host1 imap.d1.org --user1 joe --password1 secret1 --sep1 "/" \
         --host2 imap.d2.org --user2 joe --password2 secret2  \
         --noauthmd5 \
         --prefix1 "Inbox/"  \
         --regextrans2 's#^Inbox$#INBOX#' \
         --regextrans2 's#Sent Items$#Sent#' \
         --dry --justfolders

Maybe add other --regextrans2 to change folder names and see the result.
When satisfied, run without --dry --justfolders

=======================================================================
Q. Synchronising from XXX to Gmail

R. There are some details to get the special [Gmail] sub-folders
   right. Here's an example of migrating an old "Sent" folder to
   Gmail's structure:

imapsync --host1 mail.oldhost.com \
         --user1 my_email@oldhost.com \
         --password1 password \
         --host2 imap.gmail.com --ssl2 \
         --user2 my_email@gmail.com \
         --password2 password \
         --folder 'INBOX.Sent' \
         --regextrans2 's/Sent/Sent Mail/'

The same goes for the "All Mail" archive pseudo-folder.

=======================================================================
Q. Synchronising from Gmail to XXX

R. Gmail needs SSL 

./imapsync \
           --host1 imap.gmail.com \
           --ssl1 \
           --authmech1 LOGIN \
           --user1 gilles.lamiral@gmail.com \
           --password1 gmailsecret \
           --host2 localhost
           --user2 tata \
           --password2 tatasecret \
           --useheader="X-Gmail-Received" \
           --useheader 'Message-Id'

If your destination imap server doesn't like "[Gmail]" name, just add
option:
           --regextrans2 's/\[Gmail\]/Gmail/'

You can select folders exported to imap within the gmail preferences,
unselect all "System labels"

Q. Synchronising from Yahoo to XXX

R. Use --host1 imap.mail.yahoo.com --sep1 '/'

./imapsync \
	--host1 imap.mail.yahoo.com \
        --user1 billy \
        --password1 secret \
        --host2 XXX \
        --user2 billy \
        --password2 secret \
        --sep1 '/'

Can also add --ssl1 to gain encrypted transfer from yahoo.
SSL seems to be mandatory for yahoo (since november 2011)

Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are under
   /home/user/mail but the tool copies everything in /home/user, how
   can i avoid that?

Two solutions:

R. Use
   imapsync ... --include '^mail'

R. or (better)
   imapsync ... --subscribed --subscribe


=======================================================================
Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are under
   /home/user/mail directory.  When imapsync creates the folders in
   the new cyrus imap server, it makes a folder "mail" and below that
   folder puts all the mail folders the user have in /home/user/mail,
   i would like to have all those folders directly under INBOX.

R. Use 
   imapsync ... --regextrans2 's/^mail/INBOX/' --dry
   look at the simulation and if all transformations seem
   good then remove the --dry option.


=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from Groupwise to Cyrus

R. By Jamie Neil:

I eventually managed to get the mail to migrate without errors using the 
following options:

--sep1 /
  - doesn't report separator so has to be set explicitly.

--nosyncacls
  - doesn't support ACLs.

--skipheader '^Content-Type'
  - MIME separator IDs seem to change every time a mail is accessed so 
    this is required to stop duplicates.

--maxage 3650
  - some messages just don't seem to want to transfer and produce the 
    perl errors I mentioned before. This prevents the errors, but the
    bad messages don't transfer.

Even though the mail migrated OK, there are a couple of gotchas with 
Groupwise IMAP:

1) Some of the GW folders are not real folders and are not available
to IMAP, the main problem one being "Sent Items". I could find no way
of coping the contents of these folders. The nearest I got was to
create a "real" folder and copy/move the sent items into it, but
imapsync still didn't see the messages (I think because there is
something funny about the reported dates/sizes).

It think this problem has been rectified in GW6.5.

2) The "skipheader '^Content-Type'" directive is required to stop 
duplicate messages being created. GW seems to generate this field on
the fly for messages that have MIME separators and so it's different
every time.

3) Version 6.0.1 of the Groupwise Internet Connector sucks. I was 
getting server aborts when I pushed it a bit hard! I eventually had to
upgrade to 6.0.4 which seems to be a lot more stable.

Q. From any to Exchange2007 

Several problems:
- Big messages: increase the "send- and receive-connector" 
  in exchange2007 to 40 MB.

R. 2 solutions

R1. With imapsync (only partial success)
--skipsize --skipheader 'Received' \
--regexmess 's{\A(.*?(?!^$))^Date:(.*?)$}{$1Date:$2\nReceived: From; $2}gxms'
Any user having time to spend to debug Exchange2007 with imapsync
is welcome.

R2. Other solution
Two users succeded by using "MS Transporter Suite" (which is closed
expensive nonfree software).

======================================================================
Q. From Microsoft Exchange 2000 IMAP4rev1 server version 6.0.6487.0.

Q: How can I write an .rpm with imapsync

R. You'll find an RPM imapsync.spec file in the directory learn/rpm/
   It has been downloaded from
   https://svn.fysik.dtu.dk/projects/rpmbuild/trunk/SPECS/imapsync.spec
   It has been tested with imapsync 1.434 (May 2011) on CentOS5 
   and RedHat RHEL5 Linux. (Thanks to Ole Holm Nielsen).
   This imapsync.spec is derivated from Neil Brown work in 2007.
