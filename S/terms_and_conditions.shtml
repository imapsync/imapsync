Please read Our <a href="privacy_policy.shtml">Privacy Policy</a>

goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.

</p>

<h1>Termination</h1>

including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.
</p>

<p>
Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.
</p>

<h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>

<p>
Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, 
the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under 
any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of 
the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through 
the Service or nothing if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
</p>

<p>
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, 
in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any 
special, incidental, indirect, or consequential 
damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, 
damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, 
for business interruption, for personal injury, 
loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related 
to the use of or inability to use the Service, 
third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with 
the Service, or otherwise in connection with any 
provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been 
advised of the possibility of such damages and 
even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
</p>

<p>
Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or 
limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which 
means that some of the above limitations may not apply. 
In these states, each party's liability will be limited to 
the greatest extent permitted by law.
</p>

<h1>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h1>

<p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with 
all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. 
To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its 
own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their 
respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims 
all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, 
with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of 
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and 
non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of 
dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.

Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no 
warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any 
kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any 
intended results, be compatible or work with any other 
software, applications, systems or services, operate without 
interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or 
be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.
</p>

<p>
Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of 
the company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any 
kind, express or implied: 
(i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, 
or the information, content, and materials 
or products included thereon; 
(ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; 
(iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or 
content provided through the Service; or 
(iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or 
on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, 
worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
</p>

<p>
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of 
warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of 
a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and 
limitations may not apply to You. 
But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in 
this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable 
under applicable law.
</p>

<h1>Governing Law</h1>

<p>
The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall

agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by 
contacting the Company.
</p>


<h1>For European Union (EU) Users</h1>

<p>

any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you 
are resident in.
</p>


<h1>United States Legal Compliance</h1>

<p>

(i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the 
United States government embargo, or that has been designated by

<h1>Severability and Waiver</h1>

<h2>Severability</h2>

<p>

such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the 
objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under 
applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full 
force and effect.
</p>

<h2>Waiver</h2>

<p>
Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or 
to require performance of an obligation under this Terms shall not 
effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such 
performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of 
a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
</p>


<h1>Translation Interpretation</h1>

<p>
These Terms and Conditions may have been translated

</p>

<p>
