Normally, "no header used or found" means imapsync found a message
with no header. It may be a bad message with really no header
or it may be a imap server problem, the server gives no header
for this message. In that case imapsync gets the whole message
to see if there is the same on the other side. It slows the transfer
of course. I think I'll change imapsync behavior and let it 
give up those bad messages missing an header.


Add a --delete2folders option
"When syncing mailboxes with imapsync, is there a way to delete folders in the
target account? The --delete2 option only seems to delete individual
messages, not folders."


Fix the buggy --include behavior with no --folder --folderrec or --subscribed.

make --syncinternaldates turn on by default

Add different level of output to see clearly the
problem by default.

Check imapsync with gmail (dates problem?). 

Add --justlogin --justlogin1 --justlogin2 options
to check username and passwort.

Change IsUnconnected behavior. If IsUnconnected then print
stats and die. Avoid logout.

Add --subscribeall option.
Is it possible to have a option that subscribes all folders regardless of
subscription on the source server? Perhaps --subscribeall?

Add stdin/stdout filter before transfer:
"Now i asked me, how to modify your perl program to work with
that - in example, to write each mail to stdout, pipe that to the
convertion program, and read the result from stdin - and this all before
the mail will transfer to the target imap-server"

Add a --tmpdir option.

Fix bug with folder names starting with an asterisk: *Archiv
Sending: 220 SELECT *Archiv/Support/foobar
Read: 220 BAD Protokollfehler: "Invalid folder specified in SELECT command"

Add automatic convertion or detection  when 
separator inversion produces an invalid character.
From uw to cyrus, for example :
FoldA/FoldB.ext ->  FoldA.FoldB/ext

Compare speed between 1.182 and 1.217
"un mailbox de 90MB, ~2400 fichiers prends 80s avec la version 1.182 
vs 250s avec la version 1.217". Marc Jauvin

related to ACLs.

Add a best practice migration tips document,
good options with such imap server.

Not everything but flag synchronization will be nice"

DONE. Add my amazon wishlist link.

DONE. Remove file rfc2342.txt "IMAP4 Namespace"

DONE. Create a imapsync mailing list.
May be I won't since we can use comp.mail.imap
http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.mail.imap
to talk about imapsync

DONE. Add a --recurse option when --folder option is used.
No I won't since this feature can be done by doing a 
--include '^INBOX.MyFolder'
Yes done with --folderrec

Done. Look at comp.mail.imap http://groups.google.fr/groups?q=imapsync
In fact I set up an google alert on imapsync so I read
any posted question about imapsync posted  to any group
followed by google.

DONE. Add usage about --regextrans2
To remove INBOX. in the name of destination folders:
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX\.(.+)/$1/'

--regextrans2 's/^INBOX(.*)/INBOX.FOO$1/'

DONE. Make the --justconnect a real "just connect" connection,
not a auth connection like it is now.

DONE. Add --prefix1 option. Don't know what is the need exactly.
The need is to remove this prefix when building target folder names.
