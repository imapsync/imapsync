SUGGESTED 2022_07_22 by Flavio
Have a parameter to reconnect in case of failure
Exiting with return value 102 (EXIT_CONNECTION_FAILURE_HOST2)

SUGGESTED 2022_01_04 by Franck
It might be even more efficient if at the end there was a summary in 
categories for mails that did not transfer, e.g.:
xx number of mails not transferred due to missing header: use --addheader to transfer
xx number of duplicate mails not transferred: use ... to force transfer
... etc
Thus one would not have to scroll through the log unless there 
were particular mails to be inspected as to problems.

I am trying to move some e-mail using imapsync but the domain I'm moving 
to have the Danish "ø"-character which it doesn't seem like imapsync can handle.

Maybe Gmail has changed and that currently "All Mail" really contains all emails
with all the labels well set to do a good Gmail to Gmail sync but I have to 
investigate on that.

SUGGESTED 2020_12_11 by Gilles
Look at XAPPLEPUSHSERVICE for iCloud imap service Apple (Is it Dovecot masquerade?)

SUGGESTED 2020_12_11 by Gilles
Check my Office365 account (outlook.com) and play with the configuration 
to still allow imap with imapsync. It already works but it is an old account.
It looks like new O365 accounts are less likely to allow basic LOGIN imap
with a password.

SUGGESTED 2020_12_11 byTimo Smit

SUGGESTED 2020_10_15 by Alexander Perlis
Bugfix. With --delete1 duplicate messages on host1 are deleted only
one at a time, one at each run. Imapsync should delete them all on first pass.
Add --delete1duplicates


SUGGESTED 2020_09_22 by Jon Ward
--idatefromreceivedheader 
As I thought about how this option works, I wondered if it makes more sense to 
use the date from the final RECEIVED header rather than the DATE header?
This seems like a better solution since it avoids the case of wrong or 
spoofed times in the DATE header.  
Also, I would guess that in most cases the final RECEIVED header is for 
the closest server (to me) and is probably the most correct date/time.


SUGGESTED 2020_09_17 by Peter Franken
I found a bug:
If I use the parameters "--subfolder1 Sent/2017 --subfolder2 Sent/2017",
the mails from "Sent/2017" on Host 1 are transferred to "Sent/2017/INBOX" on Host 2.

Bugfix. Do fail when --minage or --maxage are employed with --search
Or make them be consistent, ie, do an AND between them.
Or at least document the bad current behavior which is that
--search overrides any --minage or --maxage

Make sanitizing an option for --subfolder1 --subfolder2
Two options? --nosanitize1 --nosanitize2 
Reflecting more I wonder if sanitizing  for --subfolder1 is just stupid.
It's not, it's good from the usage point of view, same string to point out
the destination backup/restore folder


SUGGESTED 2019_09_23 by Celko Michal.
My proposal is to create a status file.
it would be a command line option, ex. 
  imapsync ... --status-file /var/www/hosting/tmp/xyz.json
When I start imapsync process with this option, it would generate
and update this status file every few seconds, so any application
can access it and see what's going on with this process without
parsing logs or keeping up with the log format when it changes.
Example of such status file would be:

In good progress
{
"status": "in progress",
"progress": "245/5000",
"message_rate":"7.06 msgs/s",
"bandwidth_rate":"2.801 KiB/s",
"errors_count": "0",
"logfile": "LOG_imapsync/2019_09_22_09_01_42_058_abc@example.com_JDoe@example.com.txt",
"pid": "123456",
"exit_value": ""
}

On complete example*
{
"status": "finished",
"progress": "5000/5000",
"logfile": "LOG_imapsync/2019_09_22_09_01_42_058_abc@example.com_JDoe@example.com.txt",
"pid": ""
"exit_value": "0"
}


SUGGESTED 2019_07_30 by Gilles
Only since imapsync 1.774 the release check is done with 
\r\n to end lines, instead of the not RFC compliant \n.
If I upgrade Apache on imapsync.lamiral.info
ii  apache2-mpm-worker     2.2.22-13+deb7u7 amd64            Apache HTTP Server - high speed threaded model
then any imapsync prior to 1.774 will fail to GET the VERSION file.
Release check life with names:

PeerAddr "linux-france.org"      in release 1.350
"Host: www.linux-france.org\n\n" in release 1.350 to 1.466

PeerAddr "imapsync.lamiral.info" in release 1.374 and upper
"Host: www.linux-france.org\n\n" in release 1.464 but not after
"Host: ks.lamiral.info\n\n"      in release 1.467 and upper

"Host: ks.lamiral.info\r\n\r\n"  in release  1.836 and upper

Solution to test: Use the directive 
HttpProtocolOptions Unsafe # available from 2.2.32 or 2.4.24 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#httpprotocoloptions
ks5 should be ok: Server Version: Apache/2.4.33 (FreeBSD)

Write a FAQ about deciphering with imapsync.
Test it!
If the encryption is made using gpg
then the decryption via --pipemess could be just the command:
  imapsync ... --pipemess 'gpg --decrypt --no-batch --no-tty --override-session-key 9:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
where you previously ran:
  gpg --decrypt --no-batch --show-session-key some_rfc822_filecrypted.txt
in order to get the session-key "9:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

SUGGESTED 2019_02_28 by Gilles
Default tmpdir could become ./TMP_imapsync

SUGGESTED 2017_08_22 by Ismael Baena
when hmailserver hierarchy delimiter is “\”
When imapsync asks hmailserver about namespace, hmailserver returns “\\” instead of “\”. 
After that, imapsync fails when accessing any folder. Comparing hmailserver logs between 
imapsync and outlook accessing the account, I see outlook quoting every path 
while imapsync don’t, and outlook doesn’t fail.
I wrote a message to the hmailserver forum,

WANTED 2016_01_28 Stephen Sookdeo
List all emails that gives errors so you know exactly which. List with detailed info.
Then ability to perform action on these specific emails like delete or ignore per email.

WANTED 2015_06_02 Karen F Bath.
Add skipped messages in the final dump.
Print the list of messages not copied and why (duplicates or void header).
I would like to request if you could add additional errors to the bottom,
as we find that things like MaxLineLength and maxsize limit are classed
as skipped messages and in my opinion are errors; as the email message
is not transferred but this is not logged at the bottom.
We have our own scan script which we run on all log files at the end
and copy the users logs into subfolders that have issues.
I've attached a list of things we search for.

"Error", "Output"
NO Mailbox already exists, "Folder"
NO LOGIN failed, "NoLogin"
Could not create folder, "Linux"
Error sending, "Linux"
Write failed 'no error caught', "Linux"
line length exceeds maxlinelength, "Linux"
BAD Command Argument Error. 11, "Linux"
Failure: can not open, "Linux"
No not connected, "Linux"
Write failed 'Connection reset by peer', "Linux"
could not be fetched:, "Linux"
NO Mailbox does not exist,"Error"
exceeds maxsize limit 20971520 bytes,"Error"
error while reading data from server: Connection reset by peer (4x),"Error"
Folder [Inbox] already exists,"Error"

WANTED Add a well described problem for each problem detected
and counted in error counter statistics.

Look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree (David M. advice)
Look at leveldb (Simon Th actux advice)
Look at http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/ (JYB advice)
Also Redis (Ludovic Danigo advice)

I am writing now to suggest that imapsync provide info containing the parameters
with which a message is determined to be a duplicate, so that if I wanted to confirm
they are in fact duplicates by looking at the messages themselves, enough info would
be available to easily locate them.  One or two duplicates per folder are easy to
find, but I had one large folder with quite a few, and in this case it would have
been a big help.

DONE. Add a FAQ entry about long path over than 260 character on Win32.

DONE. Build and distribute a standalone Darwin Mac OS X binary.
It's called imapsync_bin_Darwin


DONE. Add a NOP for host2 for each fake copy in --dry mode.
Goal is to avoid timeouts happening only because of --dry

DONE 2015_05_09 WANTED 2015_04_25
Add an option "--subfolder2 FOO" to move all folders to a subfolder FOO:
On Windows:
    --regextrans2 "s,${h2_prefix}(.*),${h2_prefix}FOO${h2_sep}$1," \
    --regextrans2 "s,^INBOX$,${h2_prefix}FOO${h2_sep}INBOX,"


DONE. Quota are read if available and warning is printed if 90% quota reached.
Can you setup an option to make it stop if the destination mailbox reports
that it is over quota?


DONE. Add stdin/stdout filter before transfer:
"Now i asked me, how to modify your perl program to work with
that - in example, to write each mail to stdout, pipe that to the
conversion program, and read the result from stdin - and this all before
the mail will transfer to the target imap-server"
http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/reformime.html
Look at IPC::Open2, assuming a good and safe pipe,
or write more code handling all the bad stranger behaviours possible.
Option name: --pipemess "command arg1 arg2 ..."


DONE. Transform messages with too long linelength.
Office365 and Exchange abort connection
when they encounter a message with more than 10000 characters on a single line.
Could be done with the previous --pipemess with reformime.
Thanks to Larry Moore for suggesting reformime tool!
Usage: --maxlinelength 9900 maxlinelengthcmd 'reformime -r7'


DONE. Add DavMail in Similar Softwares section. http://davmail.sourceforge.net/

DONE. Convert folder names to utf-8 and print them next to the utf-7 ones.
Look at imapsync/W/learn/
./imap_utf7 data_utf7

DONE. Separate the online site in a folder site/ or www/  and make the upper directory simple.

DONE. --skipemptyfolders
Is it possible to run imapsync in a way that empty folders on host1
aren't created at all on host2? Yes with --skipemptyfolders

NO. Add an option to remove empty folders on host1, except INBOX.
Use --skipemptyfolders instead

DONE. Subject is output when APPEND fails. Done since a long time.
Suggestion: it's very difficult to track down messages which are behaving
funny during the sync. It would be great - and presumably easy to code -
to have an option to have imapsync display e.g. the subject of an
e-mail when it gets synced, rather than just the message ID and the date/time.


DONE. Add W/learn/imap_utf7  in imapsync, the folders lists output looks a good place,
if transcription is needed.

DONE. Add options --log and --logfile to log both on screen and to a file.
DONE. Document the tee command solution (Unix and Windows) in the FAQ.

NEVER. Add an option to implement the faq entry about copying a contact folder.
(write a dedicated software instead!)

NEVER. Use examine() instead of select() in --dry mode.
Add a method doing the switch automagicaly.

DONE. Write --disarmreadreceipts that does:
  --regexmess 's{\A(.*?(?! ^$))^Disposition-Notification-To:(.*?)$}{$1X-Disposition-Notification-To:$2}igxms'

DONE. With --foldersizes make the listing on host2 independent of case
(avoid "not yet created" if the folder exists in another case string)

DONE. Write --maxmessagespersecond and  --maxbytespersecond for staying under Microsoft's throttling policies.

DONE. Inform about --addheader when the problem occurs "(no wanted headers so we ignore this message)"

DONE. Print the timeout value.
DONE. Inform --timeout is is seconds.

DONE. Add an entry to http://lsm.qqx.org/lsm/
See lsm.imapsync

DONE. Fix the mailing-list archive bug with From at
the beginning of a line
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync_list/msg00307.html

DONE. Remove 2.2.9 Mail::IMAPClient support.

DONE. Add OAUTH autentication support
https://developers.google.com/google-apps/gmail/oauth_overview

DONE. Add --delete1 as an alias for --delete

DONE. Add current date at the beginning of the run, useful when imapsync
doesn't finish with statistics.

DONE. Add automatic convertion or detection  when
separator inversion produces an invalid character.
From uw to cyrus, for example :
FoldA/FoldB.ext ->  FoldA.FoldB/ext

DONE. Not done since useless now (--useuid)
Add a --skipheaderinfolder option

DONE. Not fixed since only reported once a long time ago.
Fix this:
> - Erreur avec la traditionnelle différence entre Windows

I wonder if it is Windows or the imap server used.


DONE. No Debian package anymore.
Add debian packaging in the Makefile.
Write to the debian maintener about that.

are available:
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync_list/msg01151.html
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync_list/msg01158.html

DONE. Add a note about
"One other thing: You might want to warn idiots like me, that if your
cache resides on a filesystem with a limited number of inodes such as
ext4, your inodes will be exhausted really fast (check with df -i). I
now use a dedicated partition with reiserfs."

DONE. Add an option --exitwhenover 2500000000 to avoid to be banned or locked
http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1071518

DONE. Check if a message exists before fetching it (could have been deleted recently)
      (Check avoided when UID mode is not available)

DONE. Change default --useheader 'Message-ID' --useheader Date to
--useheader 'Message-ID' --useheader 'Received'
because Exchange changes Date header! (but not Received:)

DONE. Add "output to reflect everything that imapsync was doing".
Not everything but flag synchronization will be nice"
--debugflags does this.

DONE. Add a script to install automaticaly all needed Perl modules
if needed. Not a script but command lines in INSTALL file.

DONE. Post on imapsync mailing-list when a new release comes.
No since I no longer distribute it gratis, imapsync detects
itself a new release and buyers are informed by a specific
list. I know some packagers (FreeBSD) use the Changelog file
to detect an update.

DONE. Subscribe users to imapsync_update mailing-list automatically after the payment.
(done in paypal_send)

DONE. NO became porn! Post on newsgroup comp.mail.imap when a new release comes.
http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.mail.imap

DONE. The --search option allows this (and many other things)
Add option --exclude_messages_with_flag

Subscribe only when needed (not already subscribed).

DONE. Ask Nick Czeczulin why he wrote patent "Method for mailbox migration"
http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=qI_IAAAAEBAJ

DONE. Add --search option allowing to select messages with any IMAP SEARCH command.

DONE. Make --usecache works with --maxage --maxsize etc.

DONE. Fix Exchange 2010 SP1 issue with --foldersizes when
host2 folders don't exist. $imap->exists calls STATUS.
Is it RFC compliant or an Exchange bug?
Exchange quit after 10 errors.

DONE. Make --delete2 works with --useuid

DONE. write a comment to http://blog.migrationwiz.com/2010/12/09/imapsync-vs-migrationwiz/

      Nice conversation.

DONE. Look https://fedorahosted.org/released/imapsync/

DONE. Take a look at https://bitbucket.org/imapsync/imapsync

DONE. Explain expunge behavior in help message.

DONE. Add --authmd51 --authmd52 to permit authmd5 by host.

DONE. Write option --delete2foldersonly regex.
Example: to permit a sync in a subfolder with --delete2folder
--regextrans2 's#(.*)#NEW/$1#'  --delete2foldersonly /^NEW/

DONE. Write option --delete2foldersbutnot regex.
Example: to permit a sync but not deleting folder OLD
--delete2foldersbutnot /^OLD/

DONE. Add cache to speed up transfer. Option --usecache

DONE. There was a time imapsync took the whole message when the
header was bad (empty). But it was bad for speed with big
messages (nowadays there are always big messages in
mailboxes). May be the best is to take a part of the
body. Have to code this.

DONE. Add a --delete2folders option
"When syncing mailboxes with imapsync, is there a way to delete folders in the
target account? The --delete2 option only seems to delete individual
messages, not folders."

DONE. Add NTLM authentification support. Mail-IMAPClient-3.25
support it.
http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/BUZZ/NTLM-1.05/NTLM.pm
http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/ntlm.html

DONE. Evaluate memory consumption with (or better):
print qx{ ps o pid,pcpu,comm,vsz,rss,size $$ }, "\n"
Search memory leaks with
Test-Weaken Test-Memory-Cycle Devel-Cycle Devel-Leak Test-Weaken
sh -x tests.sh ll_bigmail
sh -x tests.sh ll_memory_consumption
are good candidate to stress memory.
No memory leak detected just up to 8 memory copies of the same data
in Mail::IMAPClient.
Wrote ./learn/memory_consumption to show that it is a Mail::IMAPClient issue.

DONE.Be more effiscient with large mailboxes
Write a Mail::IMAPClient::fetch_hash allowing selecting messages to fetch
4 hours estimated time coding. Time spent 4h30 (with public release and emails)

DONE. Bugfix. Duplicate messages on host2 are not deleted with --delete2
Reason: "Skipping msg #120:508 in host2 folder INBOX.2005-INBOX (duplicate so we ignore this message)"

DONE. Ask namespace capability after login (dovecot 2).
It was a bug from library caching CAPABILITY.

DONE. Write a clean_exit() replacing each die() or exit() call.
Wrote exit_clean() and die_clean() to remove pid file.

DONE. Add a --pidfile option.

DONE. Add NOOP commands to avoid timeouts.
Useless since reconnect mode permits timeouts.

DONE. Add --subscribeall option.
Is it possible to have a option that subscribes all folders regardless of
subscription on the source server? Perhaps --subscribeall?

DONE. Add an option to make imapsync automatically
reconnect when the connection drops

DONE. Add Google adsence to imapsync website to see if it can help.

DONE. Be "FLAGS.SILENT" the normal behavior instead of "+FLAGS.SILENT".

DONE. Add TLS support with patches/imapsync-1.217_tls_support.patch

USELESS. Make --skipheader be multiple. Useless since we can
use the or perl regex '^X-|^Date|^From'


USELESS. Add a --tmpfile option.

DONE. Add --justlogin options
to check usernames and passwords.

DONE. Add a --tmpdir option.

DONE. Fix bug "Found that if folders have a space at the end of
the name, it will not create the folder name on the new
server, nor will it copy that folder's email."
Added regression test checking this.
Could not reproduce this bug.
Seems to be a old imapsync bug with 2.2.9


DONE. (contacted Date::Manip maintener) Fix bug with Date::Manip 6.02

DONE. Explain howto change only the header with --regexmess

DONE.
Change IsUnconnected behavior. If IsUnconnected then print
stats and die. Avoid logout.

DONE. Remove --password "secret"  in outpout.

DONE. Make "--delete 2" be a fatal error.

DONE.
Write to zimbra coders about the date presentation:
Sorting by default by internal date is bad with migrations
and delayed arrivals. An user option would be good.

DONE.
Add failure return code in case of
last FOLDER if $from->IsUnconnected();
last FOLDER if   $to->IsUnconnected();
See Phil Lobbes messages (18 Sep 2008)
Subject: BUG: imapsync may silently disconnect leading to unmigrated data without warnings

DONE. Fix bad english language.

DONE. Add a better test to check non existing folders on destination
server. (status and select are bad).

DONE. Fix the buggy --include behavior with no --folder --folderrec or --subscribed.

DONE. Update the distribution list including imapsync in the
INSTALL chapter. Also in README.

DONE. Start FAQ entries about good options with such imap server.

DONE. Talk about mbox and maildir format when "Invalid header"
problem is encountered. (See FAQ "Invalid header")

DONE. Look at http://barnson.org/node/81
An old blog about imap migration.

DONE. Normally, "no header used or found" means imapsync found a message
with no header. It may be a bad message with really no header
or it may be a imap server problem, the server gives no header
for this message. In that case imapsync gets the whole message
to see if there is the same on the other side. It slows the transfer
of course. I think I'll change imapsync behavior and let it
give up those bad messages missing an header.

DONE. Make --syncinternaldates turn on by default

DONE. Check imapsync with gmail (dates problem?).

DONE. Start an imap internet scan project.

DONE. Fix --ssl --justconnect bug

DONE. Fix --ssl needs --authmech login with gmail. Why?

DONE. Try a 50Mo message transfer (slow ?)
fast!

DONE. Add my amazon wishlist link.

DONE. Remove file rfc2342.txt "IMAP4 Namespace"

DONE. Add an --exactsync option to remove target messages
that are not on source. Maybe --delete2 is a better name.

DONE. Fix the "word too large" or "Command line too long"
      bug with some imap servers.

DONE. Add features from Herman (patch against 1.139 and
again with 1.156 by Kjetil Torgrim Homme)
 - Support for authenticating as different (admin) user
 - Support for different auth mechanisms (we needed PLAIN)

DONE. Make --include --exclude options possibly be a list.

DONE. Look at http://freshmeat.net/projects/freshmeat-submit/

DONE in FAQ.Talk about :
"I think notes is right but MS Eudora is bad with dates.
(netscape or thunderbird is ok with dates)
use the option --syncinternaldates "

DONE. Create a imapsync mailing list.
May be I won't since we can use comp.mail.imap
http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.mail.imap
to talk about imapsync

DONE. Add a --recurse option when --folder option is used.
No I won't since this feature can be done by doing a
--include '^INBOX.MyFolder'
Yes done with --folderrec

Done. Look at comp.mail.imap http://groups.google.fr/groups?q=imapsync
In fact I set up an google alert on imapsync so I read
any posted question about imapsync posted  to any group
followed by google.
