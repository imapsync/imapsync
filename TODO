TODO file for imapsync
----------------------

Post on newsgroup comp.mail.imap when a new release comes.
http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.mail.imap

Post on imapsync mailing-list when a new release comes.

Start a wiki for imapsync.

Add a best practice migration tips document.

Add "output to reflect everything that imapsync was doing".
Not everything but flag synchronization will be nice"

Add and option to sync to & from files.

Add an option to make imapsync automatically
reconnect when the connection drops

Add an --aclregextrans2 flag.
"Today we discovered, that Cyrus and Dovecot use different characters for 
their ACLs. Syncing ACLs vom Cyrus to Dovecot (at least 1.2) doesn't 
work. Cyrus uses c and d, Dovecot uses k and x instead." 
Peer Heinlein.

Add --subscribeall option.
Is it possible to have a option that subscribes all folders regardless of
subscription on the source server? Perhaps --subscribeall?

Add a --delete2folders option
"When syncing mailboxes with imapsync, is there a way to delete folders in the
target account? The --delete2 option only seems to delete individual
messages, not folders."

Add different levels of output to see clearly the
problem by default.

Add option --exclude_messages_with_flag

Add more information about skipped messages.

There was a time imapsync took the whole message when the
header was bad (empty). But it was bad for speed with big
messages (nowadays there are always big messages in
mailboxes). May be the best is to take a part of the
body. Have to code this.



Add Rick Romero patch with
--quiet   No output at all
--showstats  intended for use with --quiet

Take a look at Mail::IMAPTalk 
Simon Bertrang said "way better performance, less problems, easier to use and no
issues so far". Sounds good! 

Add an option to implement the faq entry about copying a contact folder.

imapsync doesn't report well. It should says "I had
to sync 123 messages but I could transfer only 99 messages"

Fix bug "not possible to use space in the imap password"

Add kerberos authentification

Add NOOP commands to avoid timeouts.

Add a --pidfile option.

Write a clean_exit() replacing each die() or exit() call.
Add a --skipheaderinfolder option 
See the code patches/imapsync_Cvitkovich_pidfile_tmpfile

Fix this:
> - Erreur avec la traditionnelle différence entre Windows
> et LInux sur les retour-chariots : le calcul de la
> longueur du message ou des entêtes à envoyer au serveur
> cible n'est pas bon sur une machine Windows.
> Ci-dessous la modif :
> 
>         # No NL Count on Windows my $length = ( -s $file ) + $bare_nl_count;
>         my $length = ( -s $file );


Add stdin/stdout filter before transfer:
"Now i asked me, how to modify your perl program to work with
that - in example, to write each mail to stdout, pipe that to the
convertion program, and read the result from stdin - and this all before
the mail will transfer to the target imap-server"

Fix bug with folder names starting with an asterisk: *Archiv
Sending: 220 SELECT *Archiv/Support/foobar
Read: 220 BAD Protokollfehler: "Invalid folder specified in SELECT command"

Add automatic convertion or detection  when 
separator inversion produces an invalid character.
From uw to cyrus, for example :
FoldA/FoldB.ext ->  FoldA.FoldB/ext

Compare speed between 1.182 and 1.217
"un mailbox de 90MB, ~2400 fichiers prends 80s avec la version 1.182 
vs 250s avec la version 1.217". Marc Jauvin

Add LITERAL+ [RFC 2088] support to imapsync.

Add an entry to
http://lsm.execpc.com/lsm/
See template lsm.imapsync

Add an option to tell imapsync that the domain
is changing and have it replace the domain in all user names that are
related to ACLs.
See patches/imapsync-acls-users

Use examine() instead of select() in --dry mode.
Add a method doing the switch automagicaly.

Add --verbose from Kjetil jumbo patch.

Read the IMAP RFC http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3501.html

Add debian packaging in the Makefile.
Write to the debian maintener about that.

Interface with external software like procmail 

Read:
http://www.washington.edu/imap/documentation/commndmt.txt.html

Add cyrus link about INBOX. namespace
http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/download/imapd/altnamespace.html

Explain expunge behavior.






DONE. Be "FLAGS.SILENT" the normal behavior instead of "+FLAGS.SILENT".

DONE. Add TLS support with patches/imapsync-1.217_tls_support.patch

USELESS. Make --skipheader be multiple. Useless since we can
use the or perl regex '^X-|^Date|^From'


USELESS. Add a --tmpfile option.

DONE. Add --justlogin options
to check usernames and passwords.

DONE. Add a --tmpdir option.

DONE. Fix bug "Found that if folders have a space at the end of 
the name, it will not create the folder name on the new 
server, nor will it copy that folder's email."
Added regression test checking this.
Could not reproduce this bug. 
Seems to be a old imapsync bug with 2.2.9


DONE. (contacted Date::Manip maintener) Fix bug with Date::Manip 6.02

DONE. Explain howto change only the header with --regexmess

DONE.
Change IsUnconnected behavior. If IsUnconnected then print
stats and die. Avoid logout.

DONE. Remove --password "secret"  in outpout.

DONE. Make "--delete 2" be a fatal error.

DONE.
Write to zimbra coders about the date presentation:
Sorting by default by internal date is bad with migrations
and delayed arrivals. An user option would be good.

DONE.
Add failure return code in case of 
last FOLDER if $from->IsUnconnected();
last FOLDER if   $to->IsUnconnected();
See Phil Lobbes messages (18 Sep 2008)
Subject: BUG: imapsync may silently disconnect leading to unmigrated data without warnings

DONE. Fix bad english language.

DONE. Add a better test to check non existing folders on destination
server. (status and select are bad).

DONE. Fix the buggy --include behavior with no --folder --folderrec or --subscribed.

DONE. Update the distribution list including imapsync in the
INSTALL chapter. Also in README.

DONE. Start FAQ entries about good options with such imap server.

DONE. Talk about mbox and maildir format when "Invalid header"
problem is encountered. (See FAQ "Invalid header")

DONE. Look at http://barnson.org/node/81
An old blog about imap migration.

DONE. Normally, "no header used or found" means imapsync found a message
with no header. It may be a bad message with really no header
or it may be a imap server problem, the server gives no header
for this message. In that case imapsync gets the whole message
to see if there is the same on the other side. It slows the transfer
of course. I think I'll change imapsync behavior and let it 
give up those bad messages missing an header.

DONE. Make --syncinternaldates turn on by default

DONE. Check imapsync with gmail (dates problem?). 

DONE. Start an imap internet scan project.

DONE. Fix --ssl --justconnect bug 

DONE. Fix --ssl needs --authmech login with gmail. Why? 

DONE. Try a 50Mo message transfer (slow ?)
fast !

DONE. Add my amazon wishlist link.

DONE. Remove file rfc2342.txt "IMAP4 Namespace"

DONE. Add an --exactsync option to remove target messages
that are not on source. Maybe --delete2 is a better name.

DONE. Fix the "word too large" or "Command line too long"
      bug with some imap servers.

DONE. Add features from Herman (patch against 1.139 and
again with 1.156 by Kjetil Torgrim Homme)
 - Support for authenticating as different (admin) user
 - Support for different auth mechanisms (we needed PLAIN)

DONE. Make --include --exclude options possibly be a list.

DONE. Look at http://freshmeat.net/projects/freshmeat-submit/

DONE in FAQ.Talk about :
"I think notes is right but MS Eudora is bad with dates.
(netscape or thunderbird is ok with dates)
use the option --syncinternaldates "

DONE. Create a imapsync mailing list.
May be I won't since we can use comp.mail.imap
http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.mail.imap
to talk about imapsync

DONE. Add a --recurse option when --folder option is used.
No I won't since this feature can be done by doing a 
--include '^INBOX.MyFolder'
Yes done with --folderrec

Done. Look at comp.mail.imap http://groups.google.fr/groups?q=imapsync
In fact I set up an google alert on imapsync so I read
any posted question about imapsync posted  to any group
followed by google.

DONE. Add usage about --regextrans2
To remove INBOX. in the name of destination folders:
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX\.(.+)/$1/'
To sync a complete account in a subfolder called FOO:
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX(.*)/INBOX.FOO$1/'

DONE. Make the --justconnect a real "just connect" connection,
not a auth connection like it is now.

DONE. Add --prefix1 option. Don't know what is the need exactly.
The need is to remove this prefix when building target folder names.

DONE. Read the IMAP RFC http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2342.txt
Respect the NAMESPACE behavior like the RFC.

DONE. Add in doc: Does imapsync support IMAP over TLS (IMAPS)?

DONE. Add the licence of each IMAP software (the free ones).

DONE. Add  MailEnable version 1.54 if 
Javier Gomez succeed. He failed.
MailEnable is an early stage developpment IMAP server.

DONE. Update doc with ALL options.

DONE. Think about speed.

DONE. Pb if "to separator" is in "from folder" name.
Have to choose a caracter != to separator and
not in from folders. The solution can be to
just exchange the two separator caracters.

DONE. Look at the separator() function in Mail::IMAPClient

DONE. Add SASL support MD5 : DIGEST-MD5 and CRAM-MD5
see authenticate in IMAPClient.pm
Test the new Mail::IMAPClient (2.1.4 -> 2.2.6 or sup)
userdbpw -hmac-md5 | userdb userdb set hmac-md5pw
http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/INSTALL.html

DONE. Add a --subscribe option to subscribe folders on the
      destination server.

DONE. Add a --subscribed option to transfert only subscribed
      folder on the source server.

DONE. Add a CREDITS file.

DONE. Pb with namespace INBOX. Some IMAP servers 
don't have this CAPABILITY
http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/FAQ.html#namespace
http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2342.txt

DONE. Pb with date

DONE. Pb with \Recent flag

DONE. Add the list of tested IMAP servers (successes and failures).
